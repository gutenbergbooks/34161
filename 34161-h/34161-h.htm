<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="title">THE FRANCO-BRITISH FORCES VICTORIOUS AT YPRES&mdash;GERMANS LOSE GROUND AT
LENS</p>


<p>On August 1, 1917, the second day of the Franco-British offensive in
Flanders, Field Marshal Haig's troops delivered a counterattack at a
late hour of the night against the Germans north of Frezenberg, and
close to the Ypres-Roulers railway. The assault, made through heavy
rain that transformed the battle field into a morass, was a complete
success, the British winning back lost ground on a front of 300 yards,
which Prince Rupprecht had captured in a dashing attack a few hours
before. At every point in this sector the British succeeded in driving
out the enemy and completely reestablished their former lines.</p>

<p>In the morning and again in the afternoon of August 2, 1917,
persistent and violent efforts were made by the Germans to win back
lost territory to the east of Ypres. In spite of heavy losses they
continued to attack at short intervals British positions from the
Ypres-Roulers railway to St. Julien. Every assault was shattered by
the British artillery barrage or the concentrated rifle fire of the
British infantry.</p>

<p>Although the constant falling rain made observation difficult the
British aviators continued active. When not scouting for the infantry
they carried out daring attacks on the German aerodromes and on
transport and infantry bodies with bombs and machine-gun fire. Few
German machines ventured above the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010"></a>(p. 010)</span> lines in the unfavorable
weather. The British airmen brought down six machines and lost three.</p>

<p>The number of German prisoners captured in this sector had now risen
to 6,122, of whom 132 were officers. The captured material included
eight field guns, fifty-three machine guns and thirty-two mortars.</p>

<p>The territory about the Ypres salient showed the devastating character
of the British fire. In many places the German dead lay in piles, and
from their position it was evident that they were in the act of
falling back when struck down. Many had fallen victims to their own
artillery, when the German gunners in frenzied efforts to stem the
onslaught of the Entente troops dropped shells among their own men.</p>

<p>East and southeast of Rheims the Germans attempted two surprise
attacks on the French positions in the night of August 1, 1917, which
were crushed. On the left bank of the Meuse there was violent
artillery action, the Germans renewing their attacks at 9 o'clock in
the evening in the sector of Avocourt Wood. The assaults failed, and
cost the Germans heavy losses. In the same region in the Apremont
Forest, southeast of St. Mihiel, attempts made to surprise the French
met with disaster.</p>

<p>August 3, 1917, the British continued to regain ground lost to the
Germans earlier in the week. They established themselves again in St.
Julien. North of the Ypres-Roulers railway large bodies of Germans
massing for a fresh attack were scattered by the well-directed fire of
British guns and were unable to deliver the assault.</p>

<p>In the course of the day (August 3) the British drove out the Germans
from most of the positions they had gained during the previous night
east of Monchy-le-Preux, and in a determined push won considerable
ground south of Hollebeke.</p>

<p class="smcap">The Western Front, 1917-1918.</p>
</div>

<p>During the night of August 4, 1917, the Canadian troops to the
southwest of Lens made a spirited dash and drove enemy patrols back
200 yards over a front of over 1,000 yards, sustaining very small
losses in the operation. The majority of the Germans scurried back to
Lens, but many were caught by the intense gunfire. The Canadians
established themselves in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page012" name="page012"></a>(p. 012)</span> buildings and ruins between
the Lens-Grenay railway and the Cité du Moulin.</p>

<p>This dashing advance further tightened the British lines around the
city. The new position gained by the Canadians was now less than 1,000
yards from the center of Lens on the western front. On the south, at
Avlon and Leauvitte, Canadian outposts were now about a mile from the
center, while opposite St. Laurent in the northwest sector their line
was about 1,500 yards from the heart of the city.</p>

<p>No attempt was made by the Germans to recapture their lost positions
and the Canadians were enabled to complete their work of
consolidation. By morning of August 5, 1917, they had linked up the
new line with barbed wire and were prepared for any emergency.</p>

<p>After five days of almost continuous rain that had hindered
observation and hampered military operations the sky cleared and the
sun shone out. The Germans were the first to take advantage of the
favorable weather and at 5 o'clock in the morning launched a heavy
attack against Hollebeke and the British post just north of the
Ypres-Commines Canal, hoping to regain the positions they had lost in
the first day of the Flanders battle. The onslaught was preceded by a
tremendous fire from the German batteries to which the British guns
replied with equal vigor and for miles around the ground was shaken by
the continued thunder of great guns.</p>

<p>After shelling British positions south and north of the Ypres-Commines
Canal the Germans attacked on both sides of the waterway and succeeded
in gaining temporary footing in Hollebeke. A spirited counterattack
launched by the British drove the enemy out and a number of prisoners
were taken. On the left front the British continued to make gains,
pushing their posts forward to the east side of the Steenbeek River
along a front of about a mile, beginning near St. Julien and running
northwest.</p>

<p>In the morning of August 5, 1917, the Germans made a heavy attack on
the French front to the northwest of Rheims south of Juvincourt. At
only one point they succeeded in penetrating the French trenches and
from this they were quickly ejected. North <span class="pagenum"><a id="page013" name="page013"></a>(p. 013)</span> of the Aisne and
at other points on the French front the Germans attacked again and
again, but were unable to win a foot of ground.</p>

<p>The Canadians, who had been closing in on Lens, made a further advance
during the night of August 5, 1917, that carried their outposts to the
main line of the German defenses on the railway embankment to the left
of the city. Two battalions in a hotly pressed attack captured a
crater east of Cité du Moulin and another to the north on the
Lens-Lieven road, which runs through the former place. These craters
had been held in strong force by the Germans from which they could
work great damage to the Canadians by rifle and grenade fire during
the night. The Canadians bombed their way forward through the ruins of
houses and fortified points and the Germans after feeble attempts to
hold fast retreated to their main positions. Having incorporated the
craters in their advanced lines the Canadians rushed forward and
bombed two tunnels that were known to be occupied by the enemy.</p>

<p>On the same night the British beat off two new attacks made by Prince
Rupprecht at Hollebeke southeast of Ypres and north of Arleux.</p>

<p>The British lines around Lens were farther advanced on August 6, 1917,
when Canadian troops pushed forward 600 yards over a front of about
the same depth, a substantial addition to their defenses south and
west on the outskirts of the mining center.</p>

<p>That the Germans were worried over the continued advance made by the
British, fearing the loss of Lens, was evidenced by their practice of
throwing a curtain of fire on the British trenches at sunrise every
day. In the morning of August 7, 1917, they directed a heavy
machine-gun barrage and artillery fire on a crater recently captured
by the Canadians. Under the protection of this shower of shells the
German infantry pushed forward and the Canadians fighting stubbornly
were forced to withdraw, without, however, suffering any casualties.</p>

<p>On the Champagne front French troops during the night of August 6,
1917, broke into the lines of the German Crown Prince at three points,
inflicting severe losses on the enemy and bringing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page014" name="page014"></a>(p. 014)</span> back
prisoners. In the Verdun sector the Germans made futile attacks
between Avocourt Wood and Hill 304. In Caurières Wood they gained a
foothold for a time in the French first line, but were driven out by a
counterattack on the following day (August 7).</p>

<p>The British front in Belgium to the north and east of Ypres was
actively bombarded during the night of August 7, 1917. Near
Lombaertzyde a British raiding party penetrated the German trenches
and brought back prisoners and guns. In the early part of this same
night the artillery on both sides was active over the Aisne front.
Troops of the German Crown Prince attempted to reach the French lines
to the east of Vauxaillon and west of the Californie Plateau but were
driven back, their ranks shattered by the well-directed fire of the
French guns. Other attempts at surprise attacks made by the Germans
north of St. Mihiel and in upper Alsace were equally futile.</p>

<p>It was during the fighting at this time that the Germans introduced a
curious device which they employed when withdrawing their batteries,
and which would cause the opponents to believe that their guns were
still in action. This was a mechanism with capsules filled with
explosives which they placed on the site of the battery that had been,
or was about to be, withdrawn. These capsules exploded at intervals of
about half a minute, and heard at some distance would be mistaken for
the reports of a field gun. Even an old campaigner would have been
deceived by this device and led to believe that he was really facing
artillery. By employing the mechanism the Germans were able to get
their guns away unknown by their opponents, and it also prevented
untimely attacks.</p>

<p>At an early hour in the morning of August 10, 1917, General Haig's
troops by a dashing drive penetrated the German lines to a depth of
several hundred yards, carrying completely the village of Westhoek and
the remaining positions held by the enemy on Westhoek Ridge. Haig's
successful stroke was delivered on a front of nearly two miles south
of the Ypres-Roulers railway. Every forward position held by the
Germans east of the town of Hooge on the fighting front between
Frezenberg and the Ypres-Menin <span class="pagenum"><a id="page015" name="page015"></a>(p. 015)</span> road was won. This section had
been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting on the first day of
the great Flanders battle. The terrain offered many obstacles in the
way of attack. The wooded sections had been strongly fortified by the
Germans, and south of Westhoek the ground was broken by marshes that
made military operations difficult.</p>

<p>Such was the spirit of the British troops on the morning of the 10th
that every objective was won in a short time despite the frenzied
efforts of the Germans to defend their positions. There was very heavy
fighting in Glencorse Wood, where the British established themselves
after inflicting heavy casualties on the Germans and taking 240
prisoners.</p>

<p>The British airmen during the day hovered over the scene of battle and
engaged the enemy machines whenever they appeared. In every aerial
engagement the British were victorious. Five German machines were
destroyed and five others driven out of control. In addition two
German observation balloons were brought down in flames and four
others sent to earth badly damaged.</p>

<p>Late in the day of August 10, 1917, the German troops made no less
than six desperate attacks on the British position on Westhoek Ridge,
but in each offensive were driven off, their ranks shattered, and with
heavy losses. The last futile attack was made at 10 o'clock at night,
and after it failed the Germans began a furious bombardment of the
sector above the village of Westhoek, which was continued throughout
the night.</p>

<p>In spite of the repeated failure of their counterattacks the Germans
renewed their efforts to regain the lost positions on the morning of
August 11, 1917. The British, who had been exposed to heavy fire
during the night in Glencorse Wood, were forced to give ground, for
their position was a salient and presented an easy mark for the German
guns near Polygon Wood and east of it.</p>

<p>About noon the British, having established their positions on Westhoek
Ridge, sent a call for the guns to hold back the enemy while they
strengthened their defenses. British airmen above the German lines had
noted great gatherings of enemy troops in Nun's and Polygon Woods.
British guns, in groups stretching <span class="pagenum"><a id="page016" name="page016"></a>(p. 016)</span> miles back into the
country, began to speak in thunderous tones. The Germans among the
shell craters in and about Nun's Wood were moving forward when the
British bombardment began. A storm of shells from the 15-inch
"heavies" to the small but deadly 6-inch and 4.2s swept over them,
around them, and through them. British airmen observed that as a
result of this withering fire the Germans lay in heaps over the
terrain and the shell craters which they had been unable to leave were
full of dead and wounded. Close fighting continued during the day, but
only at one point on the right could the Germans make any progress.</p>

<p>About 6 o'clock word came to the British gunners that German troops
were gathered in the valley of Hannebeke. Two battalions had advanced
some distance toward the British lines before the British guns got the
range. In the storm of fire that swept through them the Germans tried
to escape by flinging themselves into shell craters, but very few
found safety.</p>

<p>The failure of their counterattacks seemed to have completely unnerved
the German troops. Reserves that had been brought forward to relieve
shattered battalions lost their head completely and wandered aimlessly
about in the open, where they were shot down or surrendered.</p>

<p>The number of prisoners taken by the British since August 10, 1917,
had now risen to 454, including nine officers. In the same operations
six guns were captured.</p>

<p>During the night of August 11, 1917, French troops resumed their
counterattacks against the positions which the Germans had captured
during the night of August 9-10, 1917, north of St. Quentin. They
were successful in recovering all the trench elements lost in the
previous fighting, and also took a considerable number of prisoners.
In the sector of Noissy Farm and Laffaux Mill French scouting parties
penetrated the German lines at a number of points and returned with
prisoners. South of Ailles German troops made a determined effort to
recover trenches which the French had occupied a few days before. Two
attacks were made with strong forces, the Germans displaying a
reckless disregard of life, but their determined efforts came to
naught and the attackers were dispersed with heavy losses. The French
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page017" name="page017"></a>(p. 017)</span> not only maintained their positions but in the course of the
night made further progress.</p>

<p>During the day there was violent cannonading in Belgium and along the
Aisne and in the Verdun region. The Germans also directed a scattered
artillery fire all over the city of Rheims, killing two civilians and
wounding another.</p>

<p>In the night of August 12, 1917, Lens became the center of activity on
the British front. The Germans were desperately anxious to maintain
their hold on this valuable city, because of its important position in
the Pas de Calais coal fields.</p>

<p>The Canadian troops occupying strong positions in the western
outskirts of the city received special attention from the German guns.
They were continuously harassed too by German snipers hidden among the
ruined houses to the north of the Lieven road, and early in the night
of August 13, 1917, their advanced posts were pushed out over a front
of 600 yards and the ruins occupied, the enemy offering only a slight
resistance.</p>

<p>This advance brought the Canadians within 800 yards of the center of
the city on the west. From houses on the other side of a belt of open
ground covered with the débris of shattered buildings the Germans
directed a heavy machine-gun fire on the Canadian positions. In the
violent artillery duel that raged through the night the Canadian
gunners had far the best of it, eight explosions being noted in German
gun positions and their gun pits entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>Throughout the night of August 14, 1917, the British big guns were
sending a stream of high-explosive shells into the German positions
east and south of Loos while preparations were going forward for a big
offensive movement. The attack began at 4.25 when the first light of
dawn was glimmering in the east. For a short space of time the British
guns were silent, but ten minutes before the Canadians, crouching in
their trenches, received the order to move forward every British gun
within range poured a steady stream of fire on the German positions.
The battle scene was wrapped in pink-tinted clouds, shot with streaks
of crimson fire. Just when the time arrived for the Canadians to
strike, and when a protecting barrage was dropped before their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page018" name="page018"></a>(p. 018)</span> trenches, the clouds parted and a pale-yellow moon poured its
mild rays over the scene. It was by this light that the Canadians
advanced to attack. They mounted the famous Hill 70, where so much
blood had been spilled in days gone by, expecting that heavy fighting
awaited them on the crest, which was well manned with machine guns.
They were agreeably disappointed, however, for the German resistance
was not strong. It was only when the Canadians gained the first houses
in the outskirts that really strenuous fighting began. There was one
point where the enemy was strongly intrenched in concreted cellars
where a struggle of the deadliest description developed.</p>

<p>Lens before the war had a population of 30,000, but was now a mass of
ruins. The Germans had constructed strong subterranean defenses,
undermining the whole place with tunnels and dugouts reenforced with
concrete. Such bits of ruined buildings that remained standing had
been used for gun emplacements. It was through this stronghold that
the Canadians had to force their way. The tremendous bombardment that
preceded the attack had quite unnerved the Germans, and numbers were
seen to desert their posts and flee to the rear, but in many parts of
the outer defenses north and west of the city the garrison fought
fiercely. In an hour and a half the Canadians had pushed forward 1,500
yards, having gained most of the outward bastion of Lens formed by the
separate colonies, or "cités," so called, consisting of blocks of
miners' cottages and works united in one big mining district.</p>

<p>The most important operation during the day, however, was the capture
of Hill 70, which the British had taken and lost two years before,
for the hill commanded a wide territory and was the last dominating
position in this section that had remained in German hands.</p>

<p>August 16, 1917, marked another important advance for the French and
British. Early in the morning the Allies, striking together on a
nine-mile front east and northeast of Flanders, carried all their
objectives excepting those on the right flank. French troops on the
left drove the Germans from the tongue of land between the Yser Canal
and the Martjevaart and won <span class="pagenum"><a id="page019" name="page019"></a>(p. 019)</span> the bridgehead at Dreigrachten.
Langemarck, which had been strongly held by the Germans since the
Allied attack early in the month, was captured by Haig's troops, who
swept forward half a mile beyond. On the right the British tried to
win the high ground almost directly east of Ypres, lying north of the
Menin road, but the Germans in face of appalling losses attacked in
such fury that the British were forced to abandon the attempt.</p>

<p>More than 1,800 prisoners, including thirty-eight officers and a
number of guns, were captured by the Anglo-French forces in this
advance.</p>

<p>On the Lens battle front there was continuous fighting, the Germans
making desperate efforts to recover their lost positions. The
Canadians still clung tenaciously to Hill 70, having beaten off ten
furious attacks directed by Prince Rupprecht. The Prussian Guard, so
active in the fighting, here lost heavily. A Canadian machine-gun
officer stated that his men had killed more Germans than they had ever
seen together at any one time since fighting began here, having had as
a target for an hour and a quarter enemy reenforcements coming up in
columns of fours for use in counterattacks. The Seventh Prussian
Division was completely annihilated. The fire of the Canadian guns was
so intense that German ration parties refused to go to the relief of
their comrades on the hill, and the hundreds of prisoners taken were
in a half-famished condition, all the fighting spirit gone out of
them.</p>

<p>It was noted in the struggle here that many of the Germans were mere
children. A large number of boys, not over seventeen were in the thick
of the battle, and some were even younger, belonging evidently to the
1919 class.</p>

<p>The attitude of the civilians who had been living in the suburbs of
Lens would have puzzled a master psychologist. In the midst of terrors
they remained calm and undismayed. Some had lived there since the
beginning of the war, in houses that were repeatedly shelled and often
wrecked. Death stalked them day and night. Yet they continued their
peaceful vocations in cellars, their children being protected by gas
masks going to school. When the British soldiers appeared, and while
the shells were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page020" name="page020"></a>(p. 020)</span> bursting a few yards away, young girls and
women, for the most part neatly dressed and generally in black, were
there to greet with cheerful faces the welcome visitors.</p>

<p>On August 17, 1917, the French completed their conquest of enemy
territory south of the St. Jansbeek River and the Breenbeek River by
the capture of two strong German redoubts which had held out against
all attacks since the beginning of the great offensive on the 16th.
One redoubt, Les Lilas, was a large concrete and steel structure
strongly armed with machine guns. It was impregnable against infantry
attacks, and it was only when the French brought heavy guns to bear on
the stronghold that the German garrison surrendered. Mondovi Farm, the
other redoubt, lay in an angle formed by the St. Jansbeek and the
Breenbeek Rivers. The French bombarded the redoubt during the night of
the 17th, and after the concrete walls were shattered and crumbling
the enemy surrendered. Attempts were made later by the Germans to
shell the French out of the captured stronghold, but were not
successful.</p>

<p>On this date the Germans counterattacked in force against the Canadian
positions northwest of Lens. According to prisoners the German troops
had been ordered to retake Hill 70 at any cost. In the afternoon of
the 17th the first great attack was made, a fierce and determined
onslaught accompanied by a storm of flaming projectiles and gas
shells. The Canadians met the attack with cold steel, and the Germans
were driven back in confusion with heavy losses. Another assault made
in the evening against the suburb of St. Emilie and at Hugo Wood to
the north failed with serious losses to the attackers.</p>

<p>At 1.30 in the morning of the 18th the Germans were again in action.
Along the entire line north of Lens their infantry attacked, supported
by a concentrated artillery fire. They fought with reckless bravery,
hurling themselves again and again upon the Canadians in hand-to-hand
conflicts of the fiercest description. The latter held their ground,
though sorely beset by superior numbers. The Germans were loath to
give ground, clinging to every foot, but were slowly forced back,
their ranks shattered, leaving many dead and wounded on the field.
This was the most <span class="pagenum"><a id="page021" name="page021"></a>(p. 021)</span> sanguinary fighting in which the Canadians
had engaged since the capture of Hill 70. Never before had they used
the bayonet so freely or met the enemy in such a man-to-man grapple to
the death.</p>

<p>During the day French and British aviators were engaged in many
successful combats in the air. The British downed thirty German
aeroplanes, twelve of which were known to have been destroyed. Twelve
British machines were missing, two having collided during the fighting
and fallen within the enemy lines. On this day, and during the night
of August 17-18, 1917, French aviators shot down seven German
airplanes and a captive balloon and forced down eight other machines,
which, badly damaged, fell in the German lines. A bombing raid in
which 111 French machines took part in various sorties dropped 13,000
kilograms (28,600 pounds) of projectiles on aviation grounds at
Colmar, Friedrichshafen, and Habsheim. Aviation camps and railway
stations at other points were showered with projectiles, producing
fires and explosions.</p>

<p>British troops on the front northeast of Ypres made a further advance
in an attack made in the morning of August 18, 1917, in the vicinity
of the Ypres-Poelcappelle road east of Langemarck. By this operation
the British advanced their lines 500 yards on a like front, winning
all their objectives, including a series of strongly fortified farms.
Southeast of Epihy a successful local operation was carried out by the
British troops in the early morning of the following day, when German
trenches in the neighborhood of Guillemont Farm were captured and a
considerable number of prisoners.</p>

<p>It was in this the fourth year of the war that the Germans made some
radical changes in their methods of defense, owing principally to the
preponderance of British artillery, which reduced their front-line
trenches to mere furrows of earth and made mantraps of the carefully
constructed dugouts. The Germans now scattered their advanced forces
over a greater depth. There was no longer an unbroken line of defenses
for the British guns to shatter, but strongholds were constructed in
isolated shell holes along the front, cunningly concealed from
aviators. These <span class="pagenum"><a id="page022" name="page022"></a>(p. 022)</span> stretched back from the first lines to a
considerable depth. Along the front strong outposts were established
at some distance apart, backed by fortified craters and connected by
tunnels and often with dugouts. Back of these shell-hole nests were
gun emplacements commanding the openings between the shell holes. Thus
when enemy attackers had forced their way through the fortified shell
craters they were met with torrents of machine-gun fire. Further back
from these defenses there would be found a line of more or less
connected trenches, or a series of connected fortified shell holes.
The Germans also constructed strong concrete redoubts in every farm
house for their machine guns. They built small forts of steel and
concrete that were impervious to artillery fire. Many of these
strongholds were constructed underground with a steel trapdoor as the
only exit, by which the Germans came out to set up their machine guns.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="title">THE FRENCH BREAK THE GERMAN LINES AT VERDUN&mdash;CANADIANS GAIN AT LENS</p>

<p>North of Verdun, in a region that had witnessed many of the most
desperate struggles of the campaign in France during the previous
year, the French won a great victory on August 20, 1917. After three
days of almost continuous shelling of the German lines the French
armies attacked simultaneously on both banks of the Meuse and carried
their objectives at all points. On the west bank of the river they
gained Avocourt Wood, the summit of the famous Dead Man Hill, and the
Corbeaux and Cumières Woods. The French advance reached at some points
a depth of a mile and a quarter. Over 4,000 unwounded Germans were
made prisoner.</p>

<p>At 4.40 in the morning the French artillery preparations reached the
final phase when vigorous attacks were made on Avocourt Wood and
Bezonvaux. The first objective was won <span class="pagenum"><a id="page023" name="page023"></a>(p. 023)</span> by 6 o'clock and
German prisoners were on their way to the rear. The three days'
artillery fire had so devastated Hill 304, Dead Man Hill, and Talou
Ridge that the Germans were forced to abandon their first line. The
French found less opposition from the enemy than they had expected,
for the well-served French guns had taken much of the fighting spirit
out of their opponents. At some points, however, where the French fire
had been less felt there was hard fighting. The greatest advance made
was on the right bank of the river to the north of Vacherauville. They
occupied Talou Ridge, Mormont Farm, and Hills 240 and 344. To the east
the Germans were driven out of parts of the Fosses and Chaume Woods.</p>

<p>During the advance the French army was greatly aided in its operations
by the brilliant and daring work of its aviators. Hovering low they
showered machine-gun bullets on the enemy lines, dispersing assemblies
forming for counterattacks and bombing German gunners at close
quarters. In a series of combats in the air the French flyers brought
down eleven German machines on the Verdun front, while two others were
destroyed by antiaircraft guns.</p>

<p>An interesting phase of the fighting on the French front at this time
was the unusually large proportion of German officers captured, 201
being taken with about 6,700 men. This seemed to show that the German
officer class had deteriorated, that the best trained had been killed
or made prisoners, and that the new officers who replaced them were
lacking in spirit or had not become steeled to war work.</p>

<p>In the fighting on this front certain German army formations had been
badly smashed. Three regiments which formed the Sixth Reserve Division
of Brandenburgers and the kaiser's favorite troops were literally
annihilated as fighting units, losing sixty-nine officers and about
2,800 men as prisoners.</p>

<p>On the same day that the French were advancing in the Verdun sector
the Canadians around Lens were winning fresh laurels. Northwest of the
city they had by desperate fighting established strong posts among the
trenches and railway cuttings that formed the last line of German
defense in that quarter. This <span class="pagenum"><a id="page024" name="page024"></a>(p. 024)</span> was the scene of much strenuous
but indecisive fighting two days before.</p>

<p>From their new positions the Canadians had now command of the last bit
of ground from which the defenders of the city could overlook the
advance from the west. They were now in a hollow all around the front
which swings about Lens in a semicircular form. As every eastern exit
to the city was now subjected to a continuous and harassing fire from
machine guns and artillery, the work of bringing up provisions and
supplies of ammunition had become extremely hazardous.</p>

<p>The Canadians in their continued struggle around Lens had displayed
such irresistible courage and resolution that their deeds will long be
remembered in the pages of history. No soldiers during the war faced
more difficulties or confronted more formidable defenses. They forced
their way through streets entangled with hedges of steel and houses
bristling with machine guns. They penetrated tunnels too strong to be
touched by shell fire. They threw themselves against fortress
positions amid a fiery hail of shells and explosives. They swept
through the towns of St. Laurent, St. Théodore, and St. Emilie to the
north and west of Lens where sunken roads and slag heaps were strongly
fortified, and so on through the apparently endless and formidable
defenses to the western streets of the inner city.</p>

<p>The Germans never let a day pass without at least one attack on the
Canadian positions, and once within twenty-four hours they launched no
less than seven strong assaults. Between the attacks the men of Canada
were subjected to a heavy gunfire from a wide semicircle of strong
batteries.</p>

<p>Between August 10 and August 20, 1917, they were attacked in turn by
six German divisions, each being shattered by the Canadians' dogged
courage and amazing fighting power. These were the Seventh, Eighth,
the Eleventh Reserve, the 220th and the First Guards Reserve Division.
Besides those five divisions it was known that portions at least of
the 185th Division and of the Sixth Reserve Division had also been
engaged.</p>

<p>It was conservatively estimated by military observers of the struggle
here that the German strength used at Lens was upwards <span class="pagenum"><a id="page025" name="page025"></a>(p. 025)</span> of
50,000 men, and their losses were estimated at between 12,000 and
15,000 men.</p>

<p>At an early hour in the morning of August 20, 1917, the Canadians made
a trench raid on the German front northwest of Avlon, where heavy
fighting ensued. This front was strongly fortified by the Germans as
protection for an important mining suburb southeast of Lens, and it
was here that they had set up the guns withdrawn after the Canadian
advance two days before. Here the hand-to-hand fighting was fierce and
deadly, the Germans fighting with desperate courage, but the Canadians
got the upper hand by slow degrees, and after inflicting heavy
casualties took some prisoners and retired to their positions.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the following day the forces from Canada again
struck hard, attacking German trenches west and northwest of Lens. The
battle raged throughout the day and far into the night. The Canadians
advanced against strong opposition, using bomb and bayonet freely,
winning important enemy positions to the northwest and southwest of
the center of the city. It appears that the Germans had massed strong
forces for a counterattack at daybreak against the newly won Canadian
positions, and had already begun their forward push when they
encountered the Canadians rushing across no-man's-land. Owing to a
dense mist that prevailed at the time, the Germans did not see them
until the foe fell upon them with bomb and bayonet.</p>

<p>This dramatic surprise for the Germans seemed to have had a chilling
effect on their fighting spirit. They retreated in wild haste to the
trenches they had left, despite the frenzied attempts of their
officers to rally them. Close on their heels dashed the Canadians, and
mounting the parapets showered bombs among the other troops that had
gathered for the attack. As the Germans fled for the communication
trenches the Canadians leaped among them, and with bomb and bayonet
killed a great number.</p>

<p>In the Verdun region on this date the French continued to make
important gains. All day long the tide of battle ebbed and flowed in
waves of fire. On the left bank of the Meuse the French captured the
famous Côte de l'Oie and the village of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page026" name="page026"></a>(p. 026)</span> Régneville. On the
right bank of the river, sweeping through Samogneux, they seized an
entire system of trenches between that village and Hill 344 which had
been won on the previous day. The Germans delivered a number of strong
and determined attacks on both sides of the river, but lost heavily in
their attempts to check the French advance. Some idea of the French
gains on the left bank of the Meuse may be gathered from the fact that
when the Germans held the village of Fleury and menaced Verdun they
were two and a half miles from the fortress. On August 21, 1917, when
the French held the village of Samogneux, the Germans were seven miles
from the fortifications.</p>

<p>Throughout the day's fighting the German counterattacks failed
completely. The French maintained all their gains and organized
captured positions. Nearly 7,000 prisoners were taken during the
advance, of whom 116 were officers.</p>

<p>The capture of Dead Man Hill by the French troops was an especially
notable achievement, for its system of underground defenses made it as
nearly impregnable as human ingenuity could devise. That it could be
captured in a single day was owing to the ceaseless activity of the
French gunners, who had ravaged the stronghold with explosives so
thoroughly that it seemed impossible that anything human could
survive, however hidden underground. There were a hundred deserters to
the French lines, and the Germans surrendered in squads with their
noncommissioned officers. The whole garrison of Dead Man Tunnel, which
included two battalion commanders, were also made prisoners. When it
is considered that the Germans had 400 batteries in action back of
their front lines during the two days' advance it will be understood
that the French fighting man was heartened up and could look with
confidence to the future.</p>

<p>The British resumed the offensive in the morning of August 22, 1917,
east and northeast of Ypres along the Ypres-Menin road, capturing a
series of fortified farms and strong points in front of their
positions and gaining in the advance a third of a mile of territory.</p>

<p>Further to the north the British carried forward their lines about
half a mile over a front of two and a half miles. Owing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page027" name="page027"></a>(p. 027)</span> to
the fierce character of the fighting encountered in the forward push
the number of prisoners taken was out of all proportion to the total
losses inflicted on the enemy. Since the offensive began in the
morning of August 15, 1917, the British had taken 1,378 men, including
officers. In the same period they captured thirty-one machine guns and
twenty-one trench mortars.</p>

<p>South and southwest of Lens the Canadians continued to fight hard and
to make important gains. They succeeded in getting a firm grip on a
stronghold only 300 yards south of the main railway station of the
town. This was a huge slag pile which had been tunneled by the Germans
and was known as "Green Crassier." The odd position constituted a
barrier between the Canadians and the defenses of the city proper. It
was connected by tunnels with dugouts and defenses underneath Lens,
and the Germans, appreciating its value, clung to it tenaciously.
Preceded by a heavy bombardment the Canadians attacked at early dawn
and were atop of the Germans before the latter had any warning of what
was impending. The long series of counterattacks in which they had
been engaged during the previous days had not entirely quenched the
German fighting spirit, and the slag pile was such a network of
defenses that the Canadians were from the start roughly handled, but
they held on with dogged determination, though they had never faced
more formidable conditions, and despite the desperate efforts of the
Germans to oust them. Surrounding the slag pile or "crassier" many of
the ruined buildings had been transformed into strong and most
ingeniously constructed fortifications. The Canadians systematically
bombed their way through these defenses and drove out the defenders,
who sought refuge in the numerous tunnels under the city. Lens was
crowded with German troops of the Fourth Guards Division and the First
Guards Reserve. Forced to live among the dead and wounded in
underground caves, their lot was hideous beyond description.</p>

<p>French troops operating in the Verdun sector gained an important
victory on August 24, 1917. In the early morning they began a powerful
offensive on the left bank of the Meuse between Avocourt Wood and Dead
Man Hill. By a single charge <span class="pagenum"><a id="page028" name="page028"></a>(p. 028)</span> they carried Hill 304 and Camard
Wood to the west of it. All the German positions were captured and the
defenders made prisoners. To make doubly secure their possession of
Hill 304, the French pushed on beyond it for a distance of about a
mile and a quarter. The loss of Hill 304 and Dead Man Hill, which
commanded all the approaches and ravines as far as Douaumont, deprived
the Germans of every observation point from which they could watch the
operations of the French troops.</p>

<p>The Germans won some success against the British forces along the
Ypres-Menin road on this date, while the Canadians were forced to
retire from the crest of the "crassier," or slag-pile stronghold, and
to take up positions adjoining it. The Germans had succeeded in
bringing forward fresh troops against the Canadians, who were worn
down but not discouraged by almost continuous fighting day and night.
The enemy had the advantage of numberless underground retreats,
tunnels, subterranean chambers, and a network of cellars connected by
passages from which they could dash suddenly, and after striking a
shrewd blow disappear mysteriously from sight. The Germans were in a
precarious situation and showed a disposition to conserve their
forces.</p>

<p>On the Verdun front the French continued their victorious progress,
capturing north of Hill 304 three strongly fortified works near
Bethincourt. Since the beginning of this offensive the French had
taken over 8,000 prisoners. If they cherished any belief in the
superiority of the Germans as fighters, they held it no longer. The
German High Command had issued orders that every position must be held
regardless of the cost, but except in isolated instances they had
displayed no unusual fighting qualities, while the German officers
often perpetrated amazing blunders.</p>

<p>The French renewed the offensive on August 25, 1917, when they
delivered a smashing blow on the right bank of the Meuse in the Verdun
sector, gaining two-thirds of a mile on a front of two and a half
miles. This gave them possession of the Fosses and Beaumont Woods and
brought them to the outskirts of Beaumont. Violent artillery fighting
continued around Hill 304 <span class="pagenum"><a id="page029" name="page029"></a>(p. 029)</span> during the day. The French
continued the drive, pushing their advanced posts forward to the
southern outskirts of the village of Bethincourt and Forges Brook. A
violent counterattack made by the Germans from Wavrille Wood was
caught by French artillery fire and driven back shattered and in
disorder.</p>

<p>On the British front during the night of August 25, 1917, the Germans
were driven out of a trench northeast of Guillemont Farm which they
had captured earlier in the day. In the morning of August 26, 1917,
British troops attacking east of Hargicourt on a front of over a mile
won half a mile of ground, and carried by assault strong enemy
positions at Cologne and Malakoff Farms. About the same hour of the
morning when this advance was made the Germans under cover of a heavy
bombardment attacked in the neighborhood of the Ypres-Menin road. In
this assault flame projectors were freely used and they succeeded for
a brief time in recovering positions in the northwest corner of
Inverness Copse. Before they could organize their defenses the British
rallied and in a hotly pressed counterattack drove them out and
reestablished their positions.</p>

<p>The British did not undertake any infantry action on a large scale
during the next few days, but their guns, which far outmatched the
Germans', were not taking a rest. An eyewitness whose experience
covered many battle fields said he had never seen so many guns great
and small as on the wide stretch of country back of Ypres. For miles
he walked through concentric lines of batteries and estimated that the
British were able to fire a hundred shells to the Germans' one. It was
probably with the hope of saving man power that the Germans now built
concrete blockhouses in front-line positions capable of holding a
score of men, while keeping their main forces far back for
counterattacks. But notwithstanding their new methods of defense the
Germans lost heavily, for the British guns in forward positions kept
the enemy support lines under a constant and blasting fire.</p>

<p>Owing to the fine weather the German aviators were active. In the
course of a number of aerial engagements the British brought down four
German aeroplanes and drove three others out of control, losing two of
their own machines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page030" name="page030"></a>(p. 030)</span> It had been circulated throughout the German press that the
kaiser's forces had abandoned Hill 304 to the French for strategical
reasons. This was disproved by the discovery of an order signed by the
German commander in this sector of the Verdun front addressed to his
troops, who were urged to hold the hill at any cost and emphasized the
importance of the position as a point of observation.</p>

<p>The new French line on the west of the Meuse, now supported by the
commanding positions on Hill 304 and Dead Man Hill, ran a mile beyond
these strongholds, facing Forges Brook. On the heights east of the
Meuse and along the river the line of the French left was now extended
at Samogneux and on Hill 344. From this point the front runs eastward
down hill past Mormont Farm to the Vacherauville-Beaumont highroad,
then along the ravine between the Louvemont and Beaumont Woods up to
the plateau, including what remained of the larger wood of Les Fosses,
and so across the north to the Chambrettes Farm.</p>

<p>A comparative calm reigned in the Verdun region during August 27-28,
1917. The Germans attempted a few feeble counterattacks, and there
were times when their guns became vociferous, but no important
operation was begun, and the French had ample time to consolidate
their gains and strengthen the newly won positions.</p>

<p>In the midst of a driving rain British troops in Flanders launched an
attack in the afternoon of August 27, 1917, along the St.
Julien-Poelcappelle road. They had set out to seize some of the
concrete fortifications, each of which held a score or so of Germans
with machine guns and heaps of ammunition, who could sweep a wide
field with fire and had caused the British many losses in men. The
Steenbeke and Hannebeke Rivers had overflowed and transformed the
region round into bogs. Into this marshland the men from Yorkshire and
other English counties, drenched to the skin from being out all night,
struggled forward to destroy the Germans' "pill boxes." There was
violent fighting near the Springfield and Vancouver Farms northeast of
St. Julien, which were strongly held by the Germans. The machine-gun
fire was especially heavy at these places, but the British <span class="pagenum"><a id="page031" name="page031"></a>(p. 031)</span>
pushed forward and the Württembergers who had been sent up from
Roulers to strengthen the German advance posts, were driven back. The
British succeeded in capturing two of the concrete forts, making
prisoners of the defenders.</p>

<p>On the Aisne front northwest of Hurtebise the Germans during the night
of September 1, 1917, tried by desperate assaults to recover lost
positions, but were driven off by gunfire. North of Hill 304, on the
same date there was intermittent artillery activity, and on the
heights above the river the French foiled two attempted surprise
attacks.</p>

<p>Near Lens and La Bassée the Germans endeavored to raid British
trenches, but were repulsed. Southwest of Havrincourt they achieved a
temporary success, bombing their way into British advanced posts and
forcing the defenders to fall back. But the British quickly rallied,
and by a dashing counterattack forced out the invaders and reoccupied
the posts, taking prisoners and leaving a considerable number of dead
Germans on the field.</p>

<p>The reappearance of the sun and fair weather after days of rain made
it possible to resume military operations. The Germans were the first
to attack during the night of September 2, 1917, a British position
southwest of Havrincourt. The assault was preceded by a heavy
bombardment in which gas shells were freely used, but the British
artillery and machine-gun fire was so intense that the attackers were
driven back in disorder.</p>

<p>Southeast of Monchy on the same date the British carried out a
successful raid on the German trenches that proved a complete surprise
to the enemy. British troops were atop of the Germans before they
could make a strong defense, but finding they were inferior in
numbers the raiders, after destroying many of the enemy, withdrew with
their prisoners.</p>

<p>At Lens, where the Canadians had been holding on with grim
determination to portions of the famous "crassier," or slag pile, and
among the ruins adjoining, surrounded by nests of Germans and
subjected to almost continuous fire, there was renewed activity with
the clearing weather. During the night of September 3, 1917, the
"Kanucks" struck in upon the outer shell of Lens, gaining 250 yards on
a 600-yard front. This was really an advance <span class="pagenum"><a id="page032" name="page032"></a>(p. 032)</span> of importance,
considering the nature of the ground fought over. For the neighborhood
was packed with Germans, who had guns everywhere. This forward push
brought the Canadians in some places to the north of Lens, where there
was only an open space of about 300 yards between their positions and
the buildings of the city proper.</p>

<p>Fair weather brought renewed fighting on the Champagne and Verdun
fronts. No day passed without a German attack, but the French,
occupying commanding positions, were successful in holding their own
and slightly extended their gains.</p>

<p>In this first week of September the British air service carried on an
extensive campaign of bombing German bases back of the lines of
Belgium and northern France. Tons of bombs and explosives were dropped
with good results on railway tracks at Ghent, on aerodromes near
Cambrai, Courtrai, and Lille, and on billets around Douai. German air
raids over the British lines one night killed thirty-seven German
prisoners and wounded forty-eight.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of September 6, 1917, troops from British
Columbia, operating on the edge of the city of Lens, captured a row of
houses 300 yards long occupied by four companies of German troops.
This important success served to further reduce the area within Lens
that still remained in German hands.</p>

<p>North of Frezenberg the British carried some strong positions and
dispersed a hostile counterattack launched against them later in the
day. In the evening the Germans returned in strength to the attack and
forced the British out.</p>

<p>The Canadians around Lens continued to be in the center of the storm.
In the morning of September 7, 1917, the Germans counterattacked all
along the front to the west of Lens. After repeated efforts of extreme
violence the Canadians were bombed out of part of their positions, but
in the area of the slag pile or "crassier" the men from overseas
extended their holdings and the new front they established now became
a serious menace to German positions along the north side of the
Souchez River. This latest advance so enraged the enemy that their
entire front was deluged with the heaviest shells that had ever been
seen in this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page033" name="page033"></a>(p. 033)</span> area, while from time to time clouds of gas were
released which blotted out the scene of the battle, but not the
intrepid Canadians, whose gas masks afforded perfect protection.</p>

<p>On the French front there was continuous activity. Every time that the
German press gave notice to its public that the French military power
was waning and had become a negligible factor in the war the
indomitable Gauls by some dashing attack gave evidence that they were
very much alive and had no thought of surrender.</p>

<p>For some days the French in the Verdun sector had been busy every day
in beating off German attacks, but on September 8, 1917, they assumed
the offensive on the right bank of the Aisne and occupied important
positions on a front of a mile and a half, capturing during the
advance over 800 prisoners. Assaults on the French lines east of
Rheims and on the Aisne front resulted in crushing German defeats. At
almost every point the French wall of defense held firm, and against
it the seasoned troops of the kaiser, who lacked neither persistence
nor bravery, dashed themselves in vain.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="title">LENS IN RUINS&mdash;BRITISH ADVANCE NEAR YPRES</p>

<p>French positions on the right bank of the Meuse north of Verdun were
attacked by strong German forces in the morning of September 9, 1917.
The assault was delivered over a front of about two miles on both
sides of Hill 344. In one section of the line the Germans succeeded in
gaining a temporary foothold. By a vigorous counterattack made a
little later the French drove them out and captured fifty prisoners.
This smashing blow had cost the Germans dearly, for they left over
1,000 dead on the battle field.</p>

<p>On this date (September 9) the British forces carried out successful
local operations southeast of Hargicourt, when Northumberland <span class="pagenum"><a id="page034" name="page034"></a>(p. 034)</span>
troops carried by storm 600 yards of German trenches and took
fifty-two prisoners. East of Malakoff Farm the British attacked and
won after heavy fighting a strip of hostile trenches which was much
needed to round out their lines in that sector.</p>

<p>German prisoners captured around Lens spoke of the awful havoc wrought
by the British gas cylinders and gas shells. The German First Guards
Reserve Regiment lost twenty men when a gas shell exploded in the
cellar where they lay asleep. Another company of this regiment had
seventeen casualties from the same cause in one day. The failure of
Germany to get a sufficient supply of rubber was a contributing cause
of the gas fatalities. German masks were of poor quality and tore
easily. Masks of soft leather were used by them at this time on some
parts of the Lens front. The objection to masks of leather was that
they could not be put on as easily as those made of rubber, a serious
defect when a moment's delay might prove fatal.</p>

<p>Northumberland troops operating in the neighborhood of Villaret
extended their gains southward 400 yards in an attack made on German
trenches in the morning of September 11, 1917. During the day the
Germans attempted three counterattacks with bombs on the new British
positions but were driven off.</p>

<p>The French continued active in the Verdun region, where they had to
defend themselves from frequent counterattacks. In the Champagne
territory French troops struck a shrewd blow on September 11, 1917,
when in successful raids they drove across the German trenches between
St. Hilaire and St. Souplet and penetrated the second line. Here there
was intense and deadly fighting. The German defenders were either
killed or made prisoners, and the French captured large quantities of
supplies.</p>

<p>North of Caurières Wood, northeast of Verdun, the French advanced line
on a front of about 500 yards penetrated the German trenches and close
fighting developed. This was the scene of continuous attacks and
counterattacks for two days in which each side gained in turn a
temporary ascendancy, but the result was indecisive. It was not until
the night of September 14-15, 1917, that the French succeeded in
ejecting the Germans <span class="pagenum"><a id="page035" name="page035"></a>(p. 035)</span> from the greater part of the trench
system here and took possession. In Champagne on September 14, 1917, a
surprise attack made by the French in the region of Mont Haut was
successfully carried out. A German observatory and a number of
shelters and dugouts were destroyed and much damage wrought to the
enemy defenses.</p>

<p>No important operation was attempted by the British troops around Lens
for several days following, but bombardments were incessant. The
Canadians, though constantly under fire and subjected day and night to
strong attacks, firmly held their positions. The situation of the
Germans in the center of Lens with an active enemy occupying high
ground to the north and south was not a comfortable one. When they did
fight it was with rage and despair. Prisoners taken told of the deadly
effects of the British gas projectiles which wrought awful havoc among
the troops herded in tunnels and dugouts. The constant bombardment of
Lens had reduced the city to the same ruined condition as the suburbs.
The subterranean caverns which the Germans had built by the forced
labor of civilians two years and more before became death traps. Often
they collapsed under a heavy bombardment, burying alive whole
companies in the ruins. Again, as frequently happened, a shell would
explode inside the caves with fatal results to the occupants.</p>

<p>The Germans had every reason to wish that they had never introduced
poison gas in warfare, for as employed by the British it had become a
far deadlier destructive weapon than in their own hands. Many times
during these days the Canadians had flooded the city with gas which
soaked down into the tunnels and dugouts and stifled men in their
sleep, or they died with their masks on if they delayed a second too
long.</p>

<p>After days of raids and counterattacks insignificant when considered
as separate operations, but important in the aggregate, British troops
under Field Marshal Haig delivered a powerful attack against the
German lines east of Ypres on an eight-mile front on September 20,
1917. According to an eyewitness, the barrage that preceded the
advance was the heaviest on record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page036" name="page036"></a>(p. 036)</span> The British were successful in attaining all their
objectives. The German center along the Ypres-Menin road was
penetrated to the depth of a mile.</p>

<p>Rain had fallen steadily during the night preceding the assault, but
the assembling of the regiments assigned to the operation was carried
through without a mishap. North Country troops carried the Inverness
Copse. Australian troops stormed Glencorse Wood and Nonneboschen
(Nun's Wood); Scottish and South African brigades captured Potsdam,
Vampire, and Borey Farms; West Lancashire Territorials carried Iberian
Farm and the strong point known as Gallipoli. After making a swift
"clean-up" of these places and positions the British forces advanced
on the final objectives.</p>

<p>Troops from the counties who drove forward on the right encountered
fierce opposition in the woods north of the Ypres-Commines Canal, and
in the vicinity of the Tower Hamlets, but cut through with mighty
thrusts and gained the desired goal with light casualties. In the
center North Country and Australian battalions pierced German
positions to a depth of over a mile and won all their objectives,
which included the village of Veldhoek and the western part of Polygon
Wood. Zevenkote, farther north, was won and the London and Highland
Territorials made a clean sweep of the second line of farms, including
Rose, Quebec, and Wurst Farms, all on the line of their final
objectives.</p>

<p>Though the Germans were prepared, the British advance worked smoothly.
Some of the hardest fighting was encountered south of Langemarck to
the Ypres-Roulers railway, where there were numerous strong concrete
and steel redoubts. Many positions like Rose and Quebec Farms were
captured by the British in the face of deadly machine-gun fire, and
over a terrain of heavy mud and through pools of water.</p>

<p>When the advance was begun and the Australians went over the top, a
heavy barrage was dropped by the Germans just back of them, but many
shells fell among the advancing men and caused a number of casualties.
The Australians were in an unpleasant situation, but pressed
cheerfully forward without pause <span class="pagenum"><a id="page037" name="page037"></a>(p. 037)</span> and gained Anzac Farm, where
their standard was raised in honor of the victory.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening the British in local attacks northeast of
Langemarck drove the Germans out of the last strong points in that
region, and like operations were successfully carried out on the rest
of the front, the enemy offering only slight opposition.</p>

<p>The Germans lost heavily at every point, especially around the Anzac
Ridge, where they counterattacked six times. This ridge was one of the
key positions east of Ypres and the German command appreciated its
importance.</p>

<p>There was little change in the situation on the day following the
advance, though local fights occurred, where the Germans still held on
to some small defense, or redoubt, which the British needed to
consolidate with their new line.</p>

<p>The British captured during the push over 3,000 men of all ranks.
German officers paid an unwilling tribute to the British artillery and
machine-gun service, which had virtually shattered every attempted
counterattack.</p>

<p>The new German method of holding lines by small garrisons in concrete
blockhouses with large reserves behind for counterattacks had broken
down completely.</p>

<p>Massed attacks were made by the Germans on September 22, 1917, against
the positions captured by the British in the recent drive, but only at
one advanced point on the line did they meet with success. There was
every evidence that the Germans were making desperate efforts to stem
the advancing tide of British troops, regardless of the cost. In the
main their attacks broke down, and where they gained a little ground
it hardly compensated them for the frightful loss of life incurred.
The British were forced to yield ground south of the Ypres-Menin road,
where they had not as yet consolidated their positions. The Germans
attacked in waves from the height, and in the hand-to-hand fighting
that developed, both sides pounding away with their heaviest guns,
there ensued one of the fiercest struggles of the war.</p>

<p>East of St. Julien the Teutons pierced the British line, but were
almost immediately thrust out by a spirited counterattack. Three
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page038" name="page038"></a>(p. 038)</span> times the Germans assaulted the front east of Langemarck, but
after heavy losses and having failed to gain the slightest advantage
they drew off, greatly reduced in numbers.</p>

<p>During these days of heavy fighting the British airmen were
continually active. The weather favored observation and scout
aeroplanes and balloons performed invaluable service in finding the
range for Haig's guns and in locating centers of attack where a shower
of shells was needed. Over the wide battle area British aircraft swept
in flocks, raining down death and destruction in their flight. Ten
tons of bombs were dropped, the stations at Roulers, Menin, and
Ledeghem were squarely hit, an aerodrome bombarded, while masses of
German troops moving along the Ypres-Menin road were showered with
explosives. These offensive operations from the air cost the British
in all a dozen machines. Ten German airships were brought down and
eight others were driven out of control.</p>

<p>Though the battle of Menin road had practically ended, the British
continued to add slightly to their gains, and to strengthen their
positions. North of Langemarck in Flanders they won additional German
defenses in the morning of September 23, 1917, and took a number of
prisoners. Since the offensive began on the 20th, the British had
captured 3,243 Germans, of whom eighty were officers.</p>

<p>It was in the course of the fighting in Flanders that the Germans
employed a new kind of frightfulness in some attacks. British troops
reported that they were fired on by "flaming bullets" that set the
clothing afire. It was related that men struck by these bullets had to
be rolled in the mud to extinguish the flames.</p>

<p>During these days of busy fighting on the British front in Flanders
French troops along the Aisne and the Meuse Rivers were constantly
engaged in local fights with the enemy, though no important operations
were attempted. The French command was exceedingly careful not to
waste men unless there was some highly important advantage to be
gained, contented to act on the defensive until a master stroke could
be delivered. The German troops were not spared in the same way, but
were constantly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page039" name="page039"></a>(p. 039)</span> driven forward by their inexorable masters
and lost heavily in futile attacks.</p>

<p>On September 24, 1917, the Teutons took the offensive at an early hour
in the morning. On the right bank of the Meuse four German battalions,
supported by special assaulting troops, made a drive against French
trenches north of Bois le Chaume, along a front of about a mile and a
half. The French "75's" broke the front of the attack, but in the
center some trench elements were pierced by the Germans and violent
fighting ensued. It was a short, sharp struggle at close quarters,
when the French forced out the invaders and reoccupied the positions.
Two other German attacks on the same front were made in the afternoon
in which they gained nothing, while the French took fifty prisoners.</p>

<p>A more ambitious attempt was made on the same day to force the French
from their positions that extended from the northwest corner of Fosses
Wood to the eastern fringe of Chaume Wood, in the Verdun area. The
Germans began the assault with sprays of liquid flame, which was
followed by a furious grenade attack and bombardment. The intrepid
French troops dashed out to meet their assailants and with bayonet and
hand grenade drove them in disorder back to their trenches. There were
numerous hand-to-hand struggles between the lines. The Germans made
extraordinary efforts to regain lost ground around Hill 352, which
offered every advantage for observation, but they were unable to break
through the steel wall of French resistance. At Bezonvaux, and to the
south of Beaumont, attacks were made in the hope of distracting
attention from the real objective, but here the French Colonial
battalions were on guard, veterans known for their dash and daring,
who hurled the enemy back to his own lines, leaving heaps of dead on
the field.</p>

<p>While the French troops, fighting against overwhelming odds, continued
to hold their lines inviolate, came the painful news that their most
famous aviator, Captain George Guynemer, had been killed by the enemy.</p>

<p>Guynemer had won world-wide fame by his daring exploits. At the time
he was reported missing he had a record of having <span class="pagenum"><a id="page040" name="page040"></a>(p. 040)</span> destroyed
fifty-two German machines. Two years before he was a simple soldier.
He entered the army as a volunteer after having been rejected five
times by the medical inspectors. One of his most striking achievements
was the shooting down of three German aeroplanes in less than three
minutes in September, 1916. Captain Guynemer operated his aeroplane
alone, serving both as pilot and gunner. He was twenty-one years old.</p>

<p>At daybreak on September 26, 1917, Field Marshal Haig's troops made a
heavy attack against the German positions east of Ypres on a six-mile
front in which they won an advance ranging from half a mile to a mile
in depth. The offensive was started along the major portion of the
lines reached by the British on September 20, 1917, extending from
east of St. Julien to southwest of Gheluvelt. The most important
points involved in the new offensive were east of the city of Ypres,
between the Ypres-Roulers railway and the Ypres-Menin highway, as was
the case in the previous week. Here the Germans held elevated
positions on ridges and in forests, the vital points of their defenses
in Belgium.</p>

<p>The Australian, Scotch, and English troops engaged in this new
offensive had a desperately hard road to travel, forcing their way
over sodden and flooded ground among steel and concrete redoubts
heavily manned with machine guns. On every elevated point and in every
scrap of woods the Germans had established a vast number of
rapid-firing guns.</p>

<p>The main British attack was directed against the German front in the
Zonnebeke region. The village was stormed and the Germans were thrust
back nearly a mile.</p>

<p>To the right of this sector and north of the Menin road, there was
fierce fighting throughout the day when the British drove the enemy
from all positions and made secure the flank of their principal
advance.</p>

<p>Australian troops fighting farther south swept the Germans from
Polygon Wood and won a trench position to the east of it. Near Tower
Hamlets an important height that had been much fought over was won by
British forces, who also occupied strong field works on the eastern
slope. On the left of the main attack <span class="pagenum"><a id="page041" name="page041"></a>(p. 041)</span> there was an advance of
about half a mile along the road to Gravenstafel.</p>

<p>For days the Germans had been bringing up reenforcements in
anticipation of the British offensive. The German command,
appreciating the importance of the elevated positions, had given
orders to their troops to hold fast at whatever loss of life. The
British consequently encountered everywhere a desperate resistance,
especially on the right of the offensive around Tower Hamlets Ridge
west of Gheluvelt.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon and evening the Germans projected seven
powerful counterattacks against positions the British had captured
east of Ypres, but were unable to shake the victors' bulldog grip.
Here and there the Germans were successful in capturing a redoubt, but
were only able to hold it for a short time before being thrust out by
a well-directed counterattack. In this offensive the British captured
1,614 Germans, of whom forty-eight were officers.</p>

<p>The result of this British drive was to remove almost the last cover
for the Germans between their advanced line in Flanders and the
Ostend-Lille railway, their principal means of communication and of
supplies in this part of Belgium. Parts of this line could be clearly
seen from Zonnebeke Heights and within easy reach of the British guns,
six miles away.</p>

<p>While the British were gaining ground their naval aeroplanes were
attacking this line from the sky, dropping tons of explosives on the
Thourout and Roulers junctions and on the German base at Ostend. The
last British advance of a mile had brought this important objective
almost within reach. Its capture would result in the evacuation of
Belgium as far as the Scheldt and free the French cities of Lille,
Roubaix, and Tourcoing.</p>

<p>The Germans continued to counterattack and bombard British positions
that had been won during the advance, but they were unable to score
any permanent successes. The net result of the fighting in the Ypres
area was the capture by the British of 5,296 prisoners, including 146
officers. They had also taken during the month eleven guns, including
heavy pieces, 377 machine guns, and fifty-seven trench mortars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page042" name="page042"></a>(p. 042)</span> On the French front during these days, particularly in the
Aisne sector, there was almost continuous fighting in which the
Germans displayed dogged determination and reckless bravery, but every
attack broke down. On the right bank of the Meuse they were partly
successful in an assault on French outposts. Here they penetrated the
French center, where they held on for a time, but the French returned
in force, and after a struggle of the most sanguinary description in
which the opponents fought murderously at close quarters the Germans
were forced out and driven back to their lines.</p>

<p>North of Verdun the German attacks were especially violent. Here they
employed "flame throwers" freely, but were unable to overcome the
French resistance or to gain any marked advantage.</p>

<p>Wastage of German man power was an outstanding feature of recent
engagements on the French front. The combat front of Verdun was held
by twelve German divisions, that along the Aisne in 1917 was held by
fourteen divisions. During the same period of time from May to
September, 1916 and 1917, respectively the Germans engaged along the
Verdun front, twenty-five new divisions in 1916; along the Aisne
thirty-five new divisions in 1917. The Allied armies had so improved
their mechanical means and fighting methods that the Germans were
forced to maintain a reserve of at least forty divisions for the
safety of their battle line in the west.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="title">HAIG STRIKES AGAIN AT YPRES&mdash;THE FRENCH BREAK THE GERMAN LINES ON THE
AISNE</p>

<p>The greatest gun duel of the war continued to rage in the region
around Ypres in the last days of September, 1917. East of the city the
Germans launched six attacks during the day and night on October 1,
1917, against the British lines. Every assault was smashed by the
British artillery, rifle, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page043" name="page043"></a>(p. 043)</span> machine-gun fire. Not since
fighting began in this area had such hurricanes of shells and
explosives been seen. The Germans gambled against great odds and lost
heavily. It was only in Polygon Wood that they obtained the slightest
success. Here two small posts were won, but otherwise the British line
remained intact.</p>

<p>On October 4, 1917, Field Marshal Haig delivered another mighty blow
against the German lines east of the Ypres, gaining territory at the
most advanced point to a depth of about a mile and a half on a front
of more than eight miles.</p>

<p>The ground covered by the British assault was from north of Langemarck
on the Ypres-Staden railway to a point south of Tower Hamlets, a
height south of the Ypres-Menin highroad. The very important system of
defenses along the Passchendaele-Gheluvelt road, which the Germans had
held so long, was swept over by the victorious British troops.</p>

<p>On the northern wing they pushed on to within a short distance of
Poelcappelle and gained a footing on Gravenstafel Ridge which projects
from Passchendaele Ridge on the west, and broke through
Zonnebeke-Broodseinde Ridge of bloody memory. The crest of the ridge
was held against counterattacks which the Germans launched again and
again with desperate daring and at the cost of frightful losses.</p>

<p>The British had begun the attack at 6 o'clock in the morning. The day
was cloudy and promised rain. A mist hung over the battle field. The
advance made into the enemy country was preceded by a heavy barrage,
which, breaking in a fiery flood over the German lines, created such
terror that in many places the enemy rushed out in groups with raised
hands in sign of surrender.</p>

<p>The drive forward had forestalled a German attack which was in
preparation near Zonnebeke on the same morning. Three German divisions
here were ordered to take the line the British had captured the
previous week. As they were pushing forward they were caught in the
British barrage and met with appalling disaster.</p>

<p>The loss of the Passchendaele-Gheluvelt Ridge was a serious one for
the Germans, as it constituted a barrier between the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page044" name="page044"></a>(p. 044)</span> British
and occupied Belgium. Many important positions had been torn from them
during recent thrusts, and on the 4th the British by a dashing advance
penetrated German lines to a depth of 2,500 yards, carrying important
defenses. South of the Ypres-Roulers railway the British troops could
now overlook the slopes of the main ridge, and in some places had
pushed their way into the valley below. Along the Strombeek River, on
the left, the advance was slow owing to the marshy condition of the
ground. The troops were aided in the advance by a number of tanks
which performed immense service in reducing strong redoubts and
concrete "pill boxes." Poelcappelle, which the British reached by
10.30, though heavily garrisoned, did not offer very strong
resistance.</p>

<p>Abraham Heights, near Gravenstafel, was the scene of brief cellar
fighting, but a sharp struggle developed near the fort where the
Germans had eight strong concrete redoubts. The fighting here was
close and heavy, but in the end the German resistance broke down under
rifle fire and bomb. In the course of the day's fighting the British
took 4,446 prisoners, including 114 officers.</p>

<p>It was estimated by correspondents who visited the battle area after
the fight that the Germans had lost more killed than the number of
their wounded and prisoners combined. On one section of the Australian
front a thousand bodies were counted. A little farther south there was
another lot of over seven hundred.</p>

<p>The manner in which the German defense was conducted showed many
flaws, and indicated faulty organization. In the attempts made to stem
the advance there was a lack of cohesion among the various units that
were thrown out promiscuously along the whole battle front. The German
artillery work, too, was weak and showed imperfect planning. A great
number of Germans were caught in British barrages, and their officers
spoke of the terrifying effect of the British fire, which surpassed
anything known on that front and so dazed their troops that it was
difficult to get them to follow out orders.</p>

<p>The Germans had been punished so severely that no infantry attack was
attempted by them on the following day, and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page045" name="page045"></a>(p. 045)</span> British were
free to consolidate their gains and strengthen their new positions.</p>

<p>In the evening of October 7, 1917, a German attack in force was made
east of Polygon Wood in the vicinity of Reutel on a front of about 500
yards. For all they had made great preparations and preceded the
assault by a heavy barrage, it was quickly beaten off by British
artillery and machine-gun fire. During the day a heavy rainfall had
turned the battle ground into a morass; every shell hole became filled
to the brim, and for the time any military operation of importance
must be abandoned. After the hard fighting they had been through the
British troops welcomed a rest, though soaked to the skin, but it was
a difficult and painful task bringing in the wounded through the deep,
clinging mud.</p>

<p>In the early morning of October 9, 1917, British and French forces in
the Ypres area launched an attack north and northwest of that city and
were successful in gaining all their objectives.</p>

<p>The French troops, driving forward on the left of the British line
north of Ypres, cut through the German positions to a depth of a mile
and a quarter on a front of more than a mile and a half. The villages
of St. Jean de Mangelaer and Veldhoek and a system of blockhouses were
captured, and the advance reached the southern edge of Houthulst Wood,
seven miles to the north of Ypres. From the south the British pushed
northeast from Gravenstafel Ridge to a point about 1,000 yards
southwest of the village of Passchendaele to the heights of that name.
Between the Ypres-Roulers railway and the village of Broodseinde,
which they occupied, the British forced the Germans down the slopes
of Broodseinde Ridge on the eastern side. In these notable advances
the Allied troops gained possession of most of the observation points
that commanded a view of the great plain of Flanders.</p>

<p>A heavy rain on the day preceding the attack had transformed the
battle ground into a quagmire, and many formations of the Allied
troops having been without shelter during the night were drenched to
the skin when the order came to attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page046" name="page046"></a>(p. 046)</span> The French advance was fortunately timed. The Germans in the
first line were in the act of changing troops. A division newly
arrived from the Russian front was about to take possession. Before
they could realize the situation the French had dashed in among them,
and, killing a great many, dispersed the others in every direction.
After a brief pause, to allow the British on the right to advance, the
French proceeded to their next objective, the village of Mangelaer,
which was quickly won.</p>

<p>The British had gained in the forward movement to the depth of half a
mile on a front of about a mile, stretching from Draeibank to
Wyndendreeft.</p>

<p>Every point was won which they had fixed on as their objective, and
more than a thousand prisoners were captured during the push. The
French had gained about 1,200 yards in the two stages of their
advance, taking over 300 prisoners and a large number of guns.</p>

<p>On the day following the British were forced to relinquish a few of
their advanced posts, but in the main the positions gained in the
advance were securely held.</p>

<p>Recent rains had transformed the battle field into a vast swamp, in
which men sank to their knees, and even waists. Despite the
unfavorable conditions of the terrain, Field Marshal Haig began
another offensive early in the morning of October 12, 1917, along the
entire front in Flanders. In less than three hours his assaulting
troops had gained ground to an average depth of 800 yards, which
brought them within 500 yards of the village of Passchendaele. Further
operations were brought to a standstill by a heavy fall of rain, and
the British command decided to make no further attempts to attain
their objectives that day.</p>

<p>The storm did not abate until the following morning, when the
appearance of the sun cheered the much-bedraggled troops. But days of
fair weather must pass before the boglands that constituted the battle
area could dry up and admit of any important infantry operations. The
Germans indeed ventured a few counterattacks in the hope of wresting
from the British positions won in the last advance, but these were
smashed by artillery fire.</p>

<p>French soldiers are bringing German prisoners from
Malmaison Fort, the dominating position on the Craonne Plateau, which
was taken by the French October 26, 1917. The Germans overran the
position again in their drive of May, 1918.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page047" name="page047"></a>(p. 047)</span> The British carried out night raids on enemy trenches in the
Flanders front on October 15, 1917, and near R&oelig;ux, east of Arras.
On the Aisne front the French were successful in repulsing German
assaults and carried out daring attacks on enemy trenches in the
Champagne and Argonne.</p>

<p>For a week quiet reigned on the western front. "Quiet" meaning in a
military sense that no important infantry actions were attempted. But
each day, and often through the night, the guns on both sides were
seldom silent, and raids, counterattacks, and patrol encounters served
to keep warm the fighting spirit of the German, French, and British
forces.</p>

<p>October 22, 1917, was a day of intense activity on the Flanders front,
when, operating in conjunction with the French troops, British forces
in the neighborhood of Poelcappelle carried out a successful advance
in the southern part of Houthulst Forest, north of Ypres. Southeast of
Poelcappelle the British stormed and occupied valuable positions, and
further north, aided by French troops, a series of fortified farms and
defenses south of Houthulst Farm were won. The Germans in a spirited
counterattack checked the advance in the vicinity of the Ypres-Staden
railway, but at other points were unable to prevent the British from
pushing forward.</p>

<p>For more than a week the French forces in the Verdun and Champagne
areas had been inactive save for sporadic raids and gun duels, but
early in the morning of October 23, 1917, operating over a six-mile
front, they smashed the German lines north of the Aisne and seven
miles northeast of Soissons. This swift and dashing attack, one of
the most brilliant of the war, resulted in a gain of ground for the
French of more than two miles at one point. Over 8,000 German
prisoners, of whom 160 were officers, were captured, and seventy heavy
field and eighty machine guns.</p>

<p>The morning of the attack was misty and rainy, and it was barely light
when the French sprang out of their trenches, and, with a terrific
barrage fire preceding them, swept over the first German positions,
driving out or destroying the defenders. The front of the French
attack was from the northeast of Laffaux, in the neighborhood of
Vauxaillon, to La Royère Farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page048" name="page048"></a>(p. 048)</span> Six German infantry divisions tried to bar their way, but
these were unable to check the spirited onslaught. The various stages
of the French advance, which were carried out with precision and
dispatch, were as follows: In the first dash the French captured the
line indicated by the quarries of Fruty and Bohéry, and somewhat later
Malmaison Fort was stormed and occupied. Montparnasse quarries, which
had been previously damaged by big shells, was the scene of intensely
hot fighting before the Germans were finally driven out.</p>

<p>The French center in its advance was opposed by fresh German reserves,
and the fighting became bitter around the village of Chavignon, which
the Germans only yielded after a violent struggle. It was in this area
that the greatest advance of the day, two and a fifth miles, was made.
On the right the French took the villages of Allemant and Vaudesson,
and carried their line to the heights commanding Pargny-Filain.</p>

<p>Squadrons of tanks were active during the advance, while the French
aviators distinguished themselves aloft by showering machine-gun
bullets upon the German infantry from an altitude of not more than 100
yards.</p>

<p>The capture of the Malmaison plateau by the French was of the first
importance, for it was the key of the ridge between the Aisne and
Ailette Valleys; an unrivaled observation point commanding the Laon
plain. In gaining it the French really "turned" the Chemin-des-Dames
Ridge, to the northern slopes of which the Germans had clung so long.</p>

<p class="smcap">The taking of Malmaison and Chemin-des-Dames.</p>
</div>

<p>On October 25, 1917, the French forces on the Aisne resumed the
offensive, a general push being made beyond the positions reached in
the last advance, extending to the Oise-Aisne Canal. The village and
forest of Pinon were captured, and the hamlet of Pargny-Filain. South
of Filain the fortified farms of St. Martin and La Chapelle Ste.
Berthe were occupied. On the front between Mont des Singes (Monkey
Mountain) and Chavignon French troops made further progress and
reached Rohay Farm. The Germans counterattacked at various points on
the fighting front, but were unable to make any progress. The French
held securely all the new positions gained during the advance, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page050" name="page050"></a>(p. 050)</span> number of German prisoners had now increased to over 12,000,
of whom 200 were officers. Among the spoils captured were 120 guns,
many of the heaviest description.</p>

<p>On the British fronts in France and Flanders there were no important
actions. During the night of October 24, 1917, British aviators made a
successful raid on Saarbrücken. West of this place naval machines
dropped three and one-half tons of explosives on the Burbach works,
and other factories as well as railway communications were attacked
with good results, many explosions being noted. A train proceeding
from Saarbrücken received a direct hit from a big bomb and was
destroyed.</p>

<p>On October 26, 1917, the British and French armies north, northeast,
and east of Ypres renewed the offensive. The attacks began in a cold
rain that had been falling for several hours. Haig's troops first
advanced from a point near St. Janshoek westward through the southern
fringe of Houthulst Forest to the neighborhood of Nieuemolen. The
other assault was on both sides of the Ypres-Menin highway along the
Gheluvelt Ridge toward the town of that name. Bellevue Spur, west of
Passchendaele, was crowded with machine guns, but the British entered
it an hour after the attack began. The Germans concentrated a heavy
artillery fire on Bellevue, while the British were fighting arduously
with rifle, bomb, and bayonet among the concrete fortifications.
Through Wolf Copse, near Bellevue, that had been the scene of many
sanguinary struggles, the British swept on, gaining Polderhoek
Château, north of Gheluvelt, where there was close, intense fighting
before the Germans were forced to yield.</p>

<p>On the same date the French continued their drive against the German
positions along the Aisne. On the right of their attacking front they
captured the village of Filain and pushed their lines forward north of
Chevregny. In the Champagne area French trenches at Maisons de
Champagne were heavily bombarded. Two surprise attacks attempted by
the Germans were crushed. On the Flanders front, this day, the French
captured the village of Draeibank, Papagoed Wood, and a number of
fortified farms. Several hundred German prisoners were gathered in
during these operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page051" name="page051"></a>(p. 051)</span> According to the reports made by French aviators scouting on
the front, the Germans were preparing a retreat, for beyond the
Ailette Valley fruit trees had been cut down and farms destroyed, just
such destructive measures as the Germans had employed when they
retired on the Somme in the spring of the year.</p>

<p>The French line now ran along the southern side of the Aisne-Oise
Canal without a break, from westward of Vauxaillon to the town of
Filain. French guns could now enfilade the German positions in three
directions: northwestward of Anizey-le-Château, along the valley of
Laon, and through the Ailette Valley, threatening the German lines on
the Chemin-des-Dames Ridge.</p>

<p>German prisoners from the Empress Elizabeth's Guards Regiment captured
during the recent French advance had been without food for three days
and complained bitterly of their officers, who had slipped away and
left them without commanders during the struggle.</p>

<p>The Germans had seven divisions in action during the first day's
fighting here, and when it was evident that the tide of battle was
running against them, fresh divisions were rushed up which had
recently arrived from Galicia. The reenforcements reached the battle
field only to fall under the murderous fire of French guns, or were
taken prisoner, catastrophes which only added to the general confusion
that seems to have reigned among the Teutonic forces.</p>

<p>French troops on the Flanders front began another dashing drive on
October 27, 1917, capturing all the German positions on a front of two
and a half miles. The advance was made on both sides of the road
between Dixmude and Ypres. On the right the French gained the western
outskirts of Houthulst Wood, capturing the villages of Verbrandesmis,
Aschoop, Merckem, and Kippe, and also a system of strongly fortified
farms. Again the French had to wade through morasses into which they
sank waist deep, but there was no holding the brave "poilus" back.
Soaked with mud and water they had to attack heavily defended hamlets
and innumerable concrete blockhouses bristling with machine guns, but
every objective was won.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page052" name="page052"></a>(p. 052)</span> West of Passchendaele the Canadians were improving the
positions in this sector which they had captured in the first stages
of the battle, across the neck of the Bellevue Spur. The Germans had
endeavored by repeated counterattacks to force them out of this
dominating height, and there were anxious moments for the Canadians,
when, as the result of a struggle at close quarters, they were forced
to yield ground. But they quickly rallied, and in a fierce onslaught
drove out the Germans and recovered the position.</p>

<p>Northwest of Verdun, near Chaume Wood, the German Crown Prince's army
made a strong assault on French positions on October 29, 1917. The
attack was preceded by a bombardment of intense violence. The German
infantry pressed forward impetuously in the face of a blasting fire
from rifles and machine guns and penetrated French positions north of
Courrières Wood. But they were only able to hold the ground for a
short time, when the French struck back and forced them out,
dispersing the invaders, who fled to their own lines.</p>

<p>On the Flanders front the Canadians continued to forge their way
forward toward Passchendaele. In the morning of October 30, 1917, they
attacked the outer defenses of that place. At Meetscheede village, a
mass of ruins, there stood a number of concrete blockhouses, strongly
manned, and the struggle that developed here was fierce and bloody.
The place was only won by the individual cunning of the Canadians, who
hid among the shell craters, dashing forward separately and in groups
whenever there was a slight pause in the enemy's fire. It was slow,
hard work, and costly, but they slogged away until the German guns
were silent. Beyond Meetscheede stood another row of blockhouses, and
more intense fighting ensued, but at length the Germans gave up and
started to run, but very few were said to have escaped.</p>

<p>Another Canadian unit on the right, where the Passchendaele Ridge
stands, was fighting its way up toward Crest Farm in the face of a
heavy machine-gun fire. By dogged persistence they won the position,
and quickly turning the captured German guns <span class="pagenum"><a id="page053" name="page053"></a>(p. 053)</span> were enabled to
smash up the counterattacks which followed quickly after the positions
were occupied.</p>

<p>After these assaults that cost the Germans heavily the Canadians
passed a quiet night in their newly won trenches only 400 yards from
Passchendaele.</p>

<p>October 31, 1917, was warm and sunny and brought cheer to the
Canadians, who had been lying out all night in the chilly air in their
wet uniforms. The work of consolidating the newly won positions went
forward rapidly. German gunfire, which continued during the day, was
especially intense in the territory between Schaopbaillie and
Poelcappelle north of the scene of the previous day's fighting. Here
the Germans gained a small advantage: the British were shelled from
two outposts in fortified farms.</p>

<p>On the French front artillery battles and local engagements were
continued during October 30-31, 1917. North of the Aisne the guns
thundered on the whole sector between Vauxaillon and Pinon, and along
the new French positions in the region of Froidmont. German
detachments, which attempted to storm French posts north of the Loivre
and to the northwest of Rheims, were driven off with heavy losses. A
surprise attack in the Argonne, in the region of Boureuilles, was
defeated by the French after a sharp engagement in which the Germans
were severely punished.</p>

<p>Since assuming the offensive on October 23, 1917, the French had
captured over 12,000 prisoners, of whom 237 were officers. Large
quantities of war material were also taken, including 180 cannon.</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page054" name="page054"></a>(p. 054)</span> CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="title">GERMAN RETREAT FROM CHEMIN-DES-DAMES&mdash;THE BRITISH ADVANCE TOWARD
CAMBRAI</p>


<p>French victories resulted in the retreat of the Germans from the
Chemin-des-Dames. It began during the night of November 1, 1917, and
continued the day following. The stupendous efforts made by them to
hold this important rampart had cost thousands of lives and had been
in vain. They were forced to retire along a fifteen-mile front to the
Ailette River, the prelude, perhaps, to the fall of Laon and La Fère.</p>

<p>The Germans had been in control of the Chemin-des-Dames since
September, 1914, when Joffre turned back the Teuton armies in the
Battle of the Marne. Since then they had clung desperately to this
ridge, which dominates the valley of the Aisne and the Ailette Valley.
The German Crown Prince lost the best elements of his armies and the
best part of their effectives in the fighting here in October, 1917.
Enfiladed day and night by French guns it was impossible for the
Germans to keep their front lines supplied with food and ammunition,
for the carriers had to pass through a storm of fire in crossing the
valley of Ailette, where they were constantly under observation from
the French positions. It was in anticipation of a new offensive that
the Germans decided to retire from a position that had become
untenable.</p>

<p>Possession of the Chemin-des-Dames greatly strengthened the French
lines in the Aisne sector, giving them control of the St. Gobain
region northwest of the highway. St. Gobain is between Laon and La
Fère and dominates both those points.</p>

<p>On November 2, 1917, the French forces organized the new ground
conquered from the Oise Canal to Corbeny. Lively artillery actions
were continued in the different sectors of the Chemin-des-Dames. In
the course of the night the French made progress between these two
points and reached the south bank of the Ailette River, over the
entire front. The Germans retired to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page055" name="page055"></a>(p. 055)</span> north bank of the
stream, destroying bridges and footbridges on the way.</p>

<p>The French had received timely warning of the retreat, and an hour
after it began swarmed down along the whole front in pursuit. It was
evident that the Germans had determined hurriedly to abandon the
ridge, for the first French troops to reach the positions found tins
containing soup that was still hot. The advance was made slowly and
cautiously, for it was well known that the Germans left dangerous
traps behind them when forced to retire. In Cerny village a German
helmet was found fixed to a pole so arranged that when it was lifted
off it would cause the explosion of a mine. The Germans had passed out
of sight, but they were still heard from, their guns being constantly
active shelling the abandoned positions.</p>

<p>The French discovered trenches and dugouts and two large tunnels
almost intact owing perhaps to the fact that the Germans feared to
destroy them lest the explosions would give the alarm. The result was
that the victors had little work to do in preparing defenses, and
began their tenancy under good cover.</p>

<p>No important actions were fought on the British front in France during
the first days of November, 1917. There was fierce shelling day and
night on both sides across Passchendaele Ridge.</p>

<p>On November 6, 1917, the indomitable Canadians began a daring drive
that resulted in the capture of Passchendaele village northeast of
Ypres, a key position dominating the plain of Roulers. After taking
the place they pushed forward and occupied positions 800 yards farther
on. The German defense was far weaker than the men from overseas
anticipated, nor did the enemy launch a counterattack immediately
after the town was captured. This failure to counterattack was
afterward explained by one of the two German battalion commanders, who
were made prisoners with their staffs when Passchendaele fell. This
officer commanded a reserve battalion brought up for the express
purpose of counterattacking. He had gone with his staff to consult
with the battalion chief commanding in the village, and when both
commanders were captured their troops were left without <span class="pagenum"><a id="page056" name="page056"></a>(p. 056)</span> a
responsible head. The reserve battalion waited in a state of
indecision for the officer's return and never ventured forward, thus
giving the Canadians time to consolidate their gains. From the village
it was possible to look far over occupied Belgium, and the
possibilities for artillery work from this position were wide. Its
loss threatened the retention by the Germans of their defenses for
many miles.</p>

<p>In the course of the drive the Canadians took 400 prisoners, of whom
twenty-one were officers. The total would have been much higher, but a
number of the enemy were killed by the fire of their own guns when
they were being brought back after the taking of Passchendaele,
whether by accident or design was not learned.</p>

<p>Two days passed, and yet the Germans made no attempt to capture the
lost village, thus giving the Canadians ample time to organize their
defenses and secure a firm grip on the position. The enemy's heavy
gunfire had slackened too, because the Canadians had observation of
his old battery positions, so he relied mainly on lighter guns.</p>

<p>For months little activity had been reported on the upper Alsace
sector of the western front, but on November 7, 1917, the French made
an attack on the German positions at Schoenholz, capturing 121
prisoners including officers, and large quantities of war material and
stores.</p>

<p>Haig's troops began a new push early in the morning of November 10,
1917, northward along Passchendaele Ridge, on a front of one and a
half miles and piercing the German lines for half a mile. It had been
raining most of the night and the storm still continued when the
British forces went forward at 6.05 o'clock in the morning. The
Germans immediately threw a heavy barrage along the front involved,
and the advance was raked by machine-gun fire from numerous strong
points. The fighting was especially intense at several fortified farms
strongly held by the Germans. North of Goeberg there were several
concreted positions whose defenders fought with daring and tenacity.
Repeatedly the British stormed and penetrated these strongholds only
to be driven out a little later by counterattacks, but "dogged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page057" name="page057"></a>(p. 057)</span> does it!" and by 10 o'clock they had virtually gained all
their objectives.</p>

<p>During the morning hours of November 11, 1917, the Germans bombarded
heavily the new British positions, but no counterattack was attempted.
Along the crest of Passchendaele Ridge, north of the village, the
Canadians held their advanced line strongly. On the lower ground, to
the west, the scene of bitter fighting on the previous day, the
Germans counterattacked, and at a few points the British were forced
back, though holding on to some of the newly won positions.</p>

<p>There were many local actions at various points on the French front,
November 10-11, 1917. Surprise attacks were attempted by the Germans
northwest of Rheims and north of Samogneux, which were shattered by
the well-directed French artillery fire. On the front of Chaume Wood,
in the Verdun sector, gun duels continued intermittently day and
night.</p>

<p>In the Vosges the Germans after heavy artillery preparation made an
attack on the French trenches at Hartmannsweilerkopf. A violent
engagement developed in which the opponents fought at close quarters
and the bayonet was used freely. It was a short, sharp struggle in
which neither side was disposed to yield, but ultimately the Germans
after gaining a foothold in the French observation line were driven
off. On November 10-11, 1917, the Germans bombarded French advanced
posts in the region of Ramscappelle and Pervyse as well as their
trenches at Dixmude. The French guns replied with so destructive a
fire that the enemy batteries were silenced. Then their "heavies"
began a bombardment of German works at Woumen and positions on the
outskirts of Dixmude.</p>

<p>After several days' intense shelling of British positions around
Passchendaele the Germans made a determined effort on November 13,
1917, to recover the lost ground. They massed strong bodies of troops
in the neighborhood of Westroosebeke, advancing from the cross roads
north of Passchendaele under the protection of a violent barrage. The
British were not caught napping and their gunners concentrated a
destructive fire on the German assembly places and approaches. The
first waves of the German <span class="pagenum"><a id="page058" name="page058"></a>(p. 058)</span> advance were shattered by streams
of bullets, and only small bodies struggled through the devastating
fire to the British trenches, where after sharp fighting they were
driven back.</p>

<p>Another section of the dominating Passchendaele Ridge was wrested by
Haig's troops from the Germans during the night of November 16-17,
1917. The credit for this advance was due to the Highland, Berkshire,
and Lancashire troops, who in the darkness left their shell holes and
pushed forward over ground that was swept by machine-gun fire. The
Germans were evidently taken by surprise, or were cowed by the
impetuous dash of the British troops, for they did not attempt a
strong defense. The struggle developed to the north of the ruins of
Passchendaele village, and the British were easy winners. A heavily
fortified redoubt known as Vocation Farm gave the attackers some
trouble, but it was captured along with other strong points in the
neighborhood. The Germans did not attempt an immediate counterattack,
but increased their artillery fire on the sector.</p>

<p>On the following day the Germans made a strong raid on British lines
in Flanders in the neighborhood of Guillemont Farm. At some points
they were successful in piercing defenses, but the British
counterattacked across the open, and after a short, sharp struggle,
repulsed the invaders and took a number of prisoners. In the night of
November 17-18, 1917, Lancashire and Highland troops made a successful
raid on enemy trenches in the neighborhood of Monchy-le-Preux, where
they killed or captured many Germans and escaped with light casualties
before reserves could arrive.</p>

<p>These minor local actions were the prelude to a powerful offensive
which Field Marshal Haig was preparing, one of the greatest operations
of the war, and which broke the famous Hindenburg line. The attack was
launched on November 20, 1917, and was a complete surprise to the
Germans as it had not been preceded by any artillery preparations. The
operation was carried out by the third army under General Sir Julian
Byng, the advance being made along a thirty-two-mile front between St.
Quentin and the Scarpe River. German defenses were penetrated for a
distance of five miles at the deepest point, extending <span class="pagenum"><a id="page059" name="page059"></a>(p. 059)</span> to the
village of Cantaing, which lies less than three miles to the southwest
of Cambrai.</p>

<p>As a substitute for the usual artillery preparation the British had
secretly assembled a large number of tanks, which were sent forward
under a screen of smoke, and broke down the German barbed-wire
entanglements, opening the way for the infantry to make their forward
rushes. The British troops were in high spirits, shouting and cheering
as they pushed forward in the wake of the lumbering machines.</p>

<p>As the tanks rolled on, showering machine-gun bullets before them, the
British guns in the rear sent hurricanes of shells screaming over the
Hindenburg line. The surprise of the attack seemed to have dazed and
bewildered the Germans; many of them hid in their dugouts and tunnels
and then surrendered. The braver element got their machine guns in
action or used their rifles to snipe the British.</p>

<p>The German artillery fire was feeble, their gun positions being
smothered beneath the deluge of British shells. There were
comparatively few batteries, and their infantry gained little help
from them. It was well known to the British that they had removed many
of their guns from this sector in the past few days, as this part of
the battle line was considered "quiet."</p>

<p>During the night preceding the attack the British had massed large
bodies of cavalry very close to the enemy lines, ready for a sweeping
drive when the tanks had broken down the wire defenses. In hollows
near the German lines were thousands of cavalry horses with their
horse artillery limbered up ready for the dash forward. After the
tanks had made clear the way to advance the cavalry sprang forward
through the rain and mist. One squadron rode down a battery of German
guns, and other bodies swept around machine-gun emplacements and
through villages and captured many prisoners.</p>

<p>It was 6.20 in the morning when the tanks first pushed forward to
break down the wire entanglements and clear the way for the advance of
the British infantry. An hour later the troops were rushing through
the gaps made in the German defenses. At 7.47 British troops operating
west of Havrincourt had forced <span class="pagenum"><a id="page060" name="page060"></a>(p. 060)</span> their way up and over the
elevation known as Mount Vesuvius. It was fortunate that the movement
was carried out with dispatch, for a few minutes later the knoll,
which had been mined, was blown up by the Germans. Havrincourt was
captured in less than an hour, the Germans evacuating the place in
such haste that they had not time to inflict any serious damage. The
West Riding Territorials, who captured Havrincourt, also occupied
enemy trench systems to the north of the village, while Ulster
battalions, covering their left flank, pressed on northward up the
west bank of the Canal du Nord. La Vacquerie and the strong defenses
known as Welsh Ridge were won by English rifle regiments and light
infantry. In the course of the advance east, County troops took the
hamlet of Bonavis and Laffaux Wood after a bitter struggle that
resulted in heavy casualties to the Germans.</p>

<p>Later in the morning the British troops extended the advance at all
points. Crossings were effected of the canal at Masnières and English,
Scottish, Irish, and Welsh battalions fought together in the capture
of Marcoing and Neuf Wood. East of the Canal du Nord the West Riding
troops that took Havrincourt made important progress. They stormed and
captured the villages of Graincourt and Anneux. In conjunction with
Ulster men operating west of the canal they carried the whole German
line northward to the Bapaume-Cambrai road.</p>

<p>Important points of the Hindenburg line were penetrated east of Epihy
by the West Lancashire Territorials, while Irish troops won important
sections of the line between Bullecourt and Fontaine-les-Croisilles.</p>

<p>In the morning of the second day of the advance the British were
within three miles of Cambrai. After breaking through the German's
last defense line at Anneux and Cantaing, British tanks, cavalry, and
infantry were operating along a line running from west of Cambrai to
the south of that town. On the left, in the region of Bullecourt, the
German line had been pushed back, widening the salient which the
British drove into enemy territory south and southwest of Cambrai. In
the attack around Bullecourt the British took 700 prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page061" name="page061"></a>(p. 061)</span> The Germans had now recovered their fighting spirit, which
suffered a decline during the first stages of the British advance, and
everywhere opposed a stiff resistance. At Noyelles, Rumilly, and
Bullecourt they made desperate counterattacks during the night, but
were unable to overcome British resistance.</p>

<p>In the two days' fighting the British had captured more than 9,000
prisoners.</p>

<p>There was heavy fighting during the morning of November 22, 1917, near
Bourlon Wood, Fontaine Wood, and the village of Fontaine Notre Dame
east of it, less than three miles from Cambrai. When the British
captured the last place named, they were able to release more than a
hundred civilian prisoners, who hailed their rescuers with cheers and
many wept for joy. At Masnières the same scene was enacted, where some
hundreds of civilians were freed from the odious rule of their German
oppressors. They had been kept from starving almost entirely by the
American Relief Committee, and after America entered the war by the
Spanish-Dutch Committee. The men had been forced by the Germans to
work long hours in the fields and workshops, and the women had to
sweep the roads, wash the soldiers' dirty linen, and scrub their
quarters.</p>

<p>"For three years we lived in a nightmare," said the Mayor of
Masnières, "and now we seem to be in a dream too good to be true!" One
man had been living for three years in the cellar of his own house,
where German officers were billeted, being fed by his wife out of the
extra ration given to the baby born since the war began. Every week
the house was searched and husband and wife would have been punished
with death if the man had been found.</p>

<p>In the morning of November 23, 1917, the British drove back the
Germans from an elevation known as Tadpole Copse west of M&oelig;uvres,
commanding a large section of the Canal du Nord, which runs east of
that place and the village itself, still in German hands. At Fontaine
Notre Dame, west of Cambrai, where the British had been pushed back,
the fighting was renewed. In the eastern part of Crevec&oelig;ur village
the Germans had concentrated an intense machine-gun fire against the
British in the western outskirts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page062" name="page062"></a>(p. 062)</span> Heavy fighting continued throughout the day of November 23,
1917, at Bourlon Wood, and around Fontaine. The British held a line on
the low ground about the southern edge of the wood, and from these
positions had to charge up the slopes under the fire of many machine
guns.</p>

<p>Assisted by the tanks the British infantry made a strong forward push,
and hand-to-hand fighting ensued as soon as they had entered the
forest. Every foot of the advance was fiercely contested, but the "men
of the bulldog breed" were out to win, and by early afternoon had
driven their way through half the wood. Later in the day they gained
more ground, occupying a line through the center of the wood to the
northwest of Fontaine. In hand-to-hand combats the Germans were slowly
forced back toward the northern edge of the forest. A determined
counterattack from the north was made by the Germans in an effort to
oust the British, but they held firm. While this bloody struggle was
going on in and around the wood Fontaine village, which the Germans
held strongly, was the scene of fierce fighting. The place was heavily
fortified, and the Germans with rifles and machine guns fired from the
roofs and windows of the houses. Later in the afternoon the British
tanks took a hand in the fighting here, but at the close of the day
(November 23) the Germans were still in possession of the place,
though sorely depleted in numbers.</p>

<p>The fighting was continued in the neighborhood of Bourlon during
November 24-25, 1917, with varying fortunes to those engaged. The
Germans about noon on the 25th succeeded in driving the British from
the greater part of the village. In Bourlon Wood, where the British
held strong points on the high ground, the Germans, though repeatedly
attacking, failed to make any progress.</p>

<p>In the five days that had passed since the British began the offensive
on November 20, 1917, they had captured 9,774 prisoners, including 182
officers.</p>

<p>The Hindenburg support line west of M&oelig;uvres was attacked by British
troops, some from London, during the night of November 25, 1917. The
fighting that developed was close and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page063" name="page063"></a>(p. 063)</span> sanguinary, the losses
on both sides being considerable, but the British believed they had
not paid too dearly for the 2,000 yards of support trenches which they
won on this bitterly contested field.</p>

<p>At Bourlon Wood and Bourlon village the fighting still continued in
one of the most bitterly contested and sanguinary struggles that had
been fought up to that time on the British front in France. Bourlon
Wood, to which the British clung so tenaciously, was of special value
to the Germans if they were to hold their positions farther north, and
for that reason they were making extraordinary efforts to regain that
elevation. The British had established many guns in good working
positions and were prepared to defend it.</p>

<p>Fighting was continued on the southern edge of Bourlon village in the
night of November 26, 1917. The British broke the German line at one
point and brought back a body of English troops that had been isolated
for some time in the southern part of the hamlet. Having rescued their
fellow soldiers they made no attempt to remain in the village, but
dashed back through the gap they had made in the German lines.</p>

<p>At about 10 o'clock at night on the same date the Germans in a
counterattack struck hard against British positions on the northeast
corner of Bourlon Wood, but were driven back so decisively that they
made no further attempts to recover the lost ground. The British
artillery continued to pound the German lines effectively during the
night, but no other infantry action was attempted by either side.</p>

<p>The villages of Fontaine Notre Dame and Bourlon continued to be the
storm centers on the battle front. They were constantly deluged with
shells by both sides, and attacks were made from time to time in which
now the British and now the Germans gained some slight advantage. From
their positions in Bourlon Wood the British were shelling Cambrai
three and a half miles away.</p>

<p>On November 28, 1917, the British won a section of the ridge between
Bourlon Wood and M&oelig;uvres in the face of a heavy barrage and intense
machine-gun fire from the direction of Bourlon village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page064" name="page064"></a>(p. 064)</span> In the morning of the following day, under cover of a furious
artillery fire, the Germans delivered an attack in force on the
British positions between Bourlon Wood and M&oelig;uvres on the west. In
the first dash the Germans swept over the crest of the ridge west of
the wood and as far as the vicinity of the Bapaume-Cambrai road north
of Graincourt.</p>

<p>After the first shock of the assault the British organized a
counterattack and fell upon the advancing Germans with such fury that
the advance was checked. Fighting still continued, however, throughout
the day in this region with varying fortunes to the combatants.</p>

<p>The Germans had been concentrating their heaviest guns in this area to
replace those that had been captured by General Byng, and were using
gas shells on a lavish scale.</p>

<p>In the morning of November 30, 1917, the Germans started an important
offensive movement with the fixed purpose of driving the British from
the territory they had won in the previous week. Two great attacks
were made early in the day, one extending from M&oelig;uvres to Bourlon
Wood, the other along a 1,200 yard front southwest of Cambrai, between
Vendhuile and Crevec&oelig;ur.</p>

<p>The Germans employed strong forces, and were efficiently supported by
newly concentrated guns that had been brought forward for the purpose.</p>

<p>Over the ridge between M&oelig;uvres and Bourlon Wood the Germans poured
in dense masses, coming under fire of the British artillery as they
swept down the slope toward the Bapaume-Cambrai road. The Germans
advanced in such close formation that they fell by the score under the
intense fire from British rifles and machine guns. But where one fell
a dozen seemed to rise up and take his place, and the hordes moved
resistlessly forward like a tidal wave. British infantrymen were
thrown into the battle line for a counterattack and a murderous
struggle developed, but the Germans were too strong, nothing could
hold them back as they pushed relentlessly on, and the rush was only
checked when they reached a point in the vicinity of the
Bapaume-Cambrai highway northwest of Graincourt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page065" name="page065"></a>(p. 065)</span> Regardless of their heavy losses the Germans continued to
pour over the ridge all day long in waves of massed formation,
offering a splendid target for the British guns. Their ranks were torn
and shattered in that storm of fiery hail, but there was hardly a
pause in the advance and their numbers never seemed to diminish. Late
in the day the British in counterattacks gained ground at some points,
but the honors rested with the Germans, who by costly sacrifice of men
won important defenses and advanced their lines. Around Bourlon Wood
the British held firmly and the Germans, wearied at last of the
slaughter that had decimated their ranks, gave up attacking for the
day.</p>

<p>In the south the Germans began the attack with a force of ten
divisions; six of them were on the front line. It was planned to make
two turning movements on either side of the line, which were to
converge toward a common point. German infantry supported by cavalry
at the northern end of the line delivered an assault across the canal
from Crevec&oelig;ur toward Masnières. They succeeded in forcing their
way into the suburbs of the last-named place, but were driven out
before they could establish positions.</p>

<p>Farther to the south the Germans won important victories, when they
broke through the British front, south of Villers-Guislain, and by an
adroit turning movement to the north, surrounded Gauche Wood,
Gouzeaucourt, Gonnelieu and La Vacquerie. In this operation the
Germans advanced their lines at one point about 4,000 yards. This was
at Gouzeaucourt, which they entered about 10 o'clock in the morning,
and where fighting of the most violent description continued until
the middle of the afternoon. The British had received reenforcements,
but they were still heavily outnumbered. The fighting was at close
quarters, a merciless hand-to-hand struggle that continued for hours
without pause. The British troops, fearing the loss of their dearly
bought ground, fought with desperation and about 3 in the afternoon
succeeded in pushing the Germans out of the village and reoccupied it.</p>

<p>East of Gouzeaucourt the Germans occupied a ridge with strong forces.
During the day the British repeatedly attacked, and finally forced
them to withdraw from the height to the lower <span class="pagenum"><a id="page066" name="page066"></a>(p. 066)</span> ground, and
occupying the position, and also Gauche Wood, pushed on to the western
edge of Gonnelieu.</p>

<p>The German line in the morning of December 1, 1917, was just west of
Villers-Guislain, marking an advance of about 3,000 yards at the
greatest depth. Other less important advances were won in the north
and at Gonnelieu, and while the British regretted the loss of valuable
territory, there was nothing in the situation to cause them
uneasiness. There had been crucial periods in the fighting of the
previous day, when it seemed that the Germans would win an
overwhelming victory, and all the territory gained during General
Byng's advance would be recovered, but British determination and
dogged perseverance and unconquerable spirit prevailed, and the most
ambitious plans of the enemy were frustrated.</p>

<p>Heavy losses had been sustained by both sides. The German attacks,
made in massed formation, had caused a formidable death roll. They
claimed to have taken 400 British prisoners.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="title">GERMANS GAIN IN THE CAMBRAI AREA&mdash;COLD WEATHER HALTS IMPORTANT
OPERATIONS</p>

<p>All day long the waves of battle rolled around Masnières on December
1, 1917. The Germans made nine strong attacks, all of which were
repulsed. It was declared by eyewitnesses that the British destroyed
more Germans during the fight here between dawn and dark than in any
similar period since the beginning of the war. From the first German
assault there was no pause in the struggle.</p>

<p>Late in the day south and east of Masnières the German guns heavily
bombarded the town. The British line formed a sharp salient around the
place, which made the position difficult to hold, as it was dominated
by the high ground held by the Germans. It was therefore decided by
the British command to withdraw <span class="pagenum"><a id="page067" name="page067"></a>(p. 067)</span> to the southeastern outskirts
of the town and there establish the line to the great benefit of the
entire front.</p>

<p>Gonnelieu, which the British captured during the day, though the
Germans still clung to portions of the ruins, was completely "cleaned
up" during the night, about 300 prisoners being taken here. After the
recapture of Gauche Wood the British continued to push on up to the
higher ground southwest of the wood. During the assault on Gauche Wood
one British tank captured fifteen machine guns from the enemy.</p>

<p>December 2, 1917, the Germans continued their terrific attacks on the
British front south and southwest of Cambrai. With a mighty
concentration of artillery, and employing great forces of infantry,
they tried to pierce the British defenses in the Gonnelieu sector, but
General Byng's army had been strongly reenforced and held fast.</p>

<p>The battle began along a front that extended from La Vacquerie
southward to Vendhuile. The Germans attacked British positions at La
Vacquerie at 8:45 in the morning, and penetrated the village, but only
won temporary foothold, when they were forced out. As the day wore on
the fighting spread northward toward Masnières, which the British had
evacuated on the previous day. During the night the town was an
uncomfortable place to hold, as the British continued to deluge it
with shells and the Germans were forced to find refuge in tunnels and
dugouts. Southwest of Bourlon village General Byng's troops won back a
trench system that the Germans had captured during the push of
November 30, 1917. Bourlon Wood was again in possession of the
British, though a few Germans still clung to some points on the
outskirts. South of Marcoing the Germans continued their powerful
attacks on the British lines, but were unable to cut through the
defenses.</p>

<p class="smcap">The battle of Cambrai.</p>
</div>

<p>Under cover of the darkness the British withdrew from the salient
about Bourlon Wood during the night of December 4-5, 1917, to a
prepared line which would be stronger and easier to hold. Not until
some hours had passed did the Germans discover the retirement, when
they swarmed into the vacant territory and dug themselves in. Bourlon
Wood had been generally <span class="pagenum"><a id="page069" name="page069"></a>(p. 069)</span> stripped of troops; only a rear guard
being left when the British retired, and they were later withdrawn.
The Germans continued, however, to bombard the wood, showing that they
were all in the dark concerning British movements.</p>

<p>The devastated area which the British had abandoned, and which
included the mined towns of Graincourt, Anneux, Cantaing, Noyelles,
Marcoing, and Masnières, was gradually occupied by the Germans. They
had no easy task before them, for the British guns dominated this
desert with tons of explosives, and hundreds of shells were hurled
into their advanced ranks as they went forward to prospect for
desirable positions for defense. Meanwhile the British army had found
exceptional quarters in the captured Hindenburg trenches with their
wonderful dugouts and network of front-line and communication
trenches, all ready for occupancy.</p>

<p>There was continued fighting during the 6th between advanced patrols
of British and Germans. North of La Vacquerie Ulster troops won some
important defenses that strengthened the British line.</p>

<p>Artillery duels and sporadic raids were the only military events in
this fighting area during the several succeeding days. The British
anticipated that this lull would be followed by renewed fighting, for
it was known that the Germans had been bringing forward strong
reenforcements, probably from the Russian front.</p>

<p>The German offensive began on December 12, 1917, but was far from
being as formidable as the British feared. The first attack was made
at dawn against an elbow in the bend of the British line between
Bullecourt and Queant, about ten miles west of Cambrai. The Germans
were in strong force, the troops, principally from Bavaria, advancing
in waves and close formation, and by sheer weight of numbers won about
500 yards of front-line trenches before they could be checked. Other
attacks were made from the east, and the third south of Riencourt,
both of which were shattered by British rifle and machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>The Germans were evidently trying to discover weak spots in the
British lines by a process of testing, for on December 14, 1917, they
made an assault on the Ypres front in Flanders. The stroke <span class="pagenum"><a id="page070" name="page070"></a>(p. 070)</span>
was delivered on a front of about 300 yards southeast of Polygon Wood,
against British positions near Polderhoek Château. They won a section
of front-line trench, but were repulsed at all other points of attack.</p>

<p>East of Bullecourt, in the Cambrai area, German gunfire had increased
in violence. During the night the British engaged in bomb fighting
that was highly successful, and enabled them to improve their lines.
North of Bullecourt in the afternoon of December 15, 1917, the British
carried out a successful raid in which a number of prisoners were
captured and enemy dugouts and defenses were destroyed.</p>

<p>Snow began to fall during the night on this date, and by morning the
countryside was deeply covered, and the ugly scars of battle hidden
from sight. The snow lay in heavy drifts on the roads and fields. No
military operation was possible, and even the sinister-looking guns
were silent.</p>

<p>This white truce was appreciated by the British as it must have been
by the soldiers of the kaiser, for both armies had been under a severe
strain since General Byng's advance on Cambrai, November 20, 1917.</p>

<p>It was estimated by conservative military observers that the German
strength on the Franco-British front at this time was 154 divisions,
one less than the great force amassed here in the previous July, when
the German military effort against France was at its maximum.</p>

<p>During these momentous days on the British battle front the French
had been nibbling away at the German positions around Verdun and along
the Aisne and Meuse Rivers. The capture of the entire line of lights
through which runs the famous Chemin-des-Dames had given them command
of the strongest positions in that region. The Germans, forced to
retire across the Ailette and to abandon the whole valley to the
French, were so situated that it would be taking a gambler's chance to
attempt an offensive on a large scale. Nor was a direct attack on
Verdun probable, for they had lost all their gains on both sides of
the Meuse, while every point of vantage in this sector was in
possession of the soldiers of the Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page071" name="page071"></a>(p. 071)</span> The Champagne front between Rheims and Verdun offered the
most favorable field for the Germans to deliver a hard blow. By a
strong offensive the French positions to the east, in the Argonne
Forest, might be turned, compelling the French to draw their lines
back; converting into a narrow-necked wedge the Verdun lines, which
would be hemmed in on nearly every side.</p>

<p>On the Alsace and Lorraine fronts there was little to fear of any
strong action on the part of the Germans, as every movement must be
made through narrow passes, conditions that rendered large operations
impossible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Germans were evidently testing the French fronts for a
weak spot where they might strike a shrewd blow. Around Verdun and
farther east the German guns thundered unceasingly, and German trench
raids were of daily and nightly occurrence throughout the month of
December. For "a worn-out army," as the French troops had been called
by their enemies, they fought with astonishing spirit. The Germans
made slight gains from time to time, but they were unable to retain
them.</p>

<p>On the Cambrai front the fighting was confined to raids and minor
actions of slight importance. On December 30, 1917, the Germans made
strong local attacks on a front of over two miles against the British
position on the spur known as Welsh Ridge south of Cambrai. The
attackers were forced back in the center, but on the right, toward the
north of La Vacquerie, and on the left to the south of Marcoing, they
penetrated and occupied two small salients in the British lines. In
the morning of the following day, after a short but heavy
bombardment, the Germans renewed their attack against Welsh Ridge on a
front of about 1,200 yards south of Marcoing. The southern portion was
assaulted by strong forces, and assisted by liquid fire they succeeded
in gaining a foothold in one of the British trenches. The gain was
only temporary, for the British quickly rallied, and in a fierce
counterattack drove out the invaders and reoccupied the entire trench
system.</p>

<p>German artillery thundered unceasingly throughout the day on January
1, 1918, near La Vacquerie on the Cambrai front, and in the Lens,
Armentières and Ypres sectors. In the evening, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page072" name="page072"></a>(p. 072)</span> under cover of
a heavy bombardment, three bodies of German troops attempted to raid
British positions in the vicinity of Méricourt southeast of Lens. The
assaulting troops came under the concentrated fire of the British
artillery and were hurled back with heavy losses before they could
reach their objectives. In no-man's-land these disorganized Germans
ran into a British patrol, and again lost heavily, very few escaping
from the field.</p>

<p>The British front was now in the icy grip of winter. Snow-drifts made
the roads impassable for motor cars. The Germans, however, were not
deterred by unfavorable weather conditions from making sporadic raids
on British positions. On January 5, 1918, they had some success at
Bullecourt, where they captured a British advance post&mdash;a dearly
bought operation that cost them a heavy toll in casualties. In the
afternoon the British came back in force, and, after a tense, close
struggle, drove out the Germans and reoccupied the position.</p>

<p>On the French front, where a blizzard had been raging and the heaviest
snowstorm in years made military operations on any large scale
impossible, the Germans continued to be active, and the French were
kept busy defending their costly won positions.</p>

<p>On January 8, 1918, French troops carried out an extensive and
successful raid which was intrusted to foreign legionaries and
sharpshooters. The attack was delivered along a front of a mile and to
a depth of half a mile in front of Flirey and westward toward St.
Mihiel. The French completely cleaned out the German defenses,
capturing 178 men and officers and numbers of machine guns and trench
mortars. The Germans were so completely taken by surprise that their
artillery did not get into action until the French had finished the
job. The attack was carried out with such dispatch and in so thorough
a manner that the French suffered not more than a dozen casualties,
while the German dead lay thick about the field and the snow was
streaked with ominous stains.</p>

<p>On the same date (January 8) the spell of silence which had brooded
for some days on the British front was broken by a hostile attack made
by the Germans east of Bullecourt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page073" name="page073"></a>(p. 073)</span> In the early dawn the British lines were bombarded with high
explosives and gas, and about 6.35 three parties of Bavarian troops,
who had been lying concealed during the night in no-man's-land, made a
quick rush for the British defenses. The front line attacked had been
weakened by the recent withdrawal of troops, as an enemy attack was
not expected in a sector considered "quiet."</p>

<p>Two of the parties of Bavarians carried flame throwers of the most
approved type, which darted a jet of fire thirty feet, and literally
wiped out with a touch a man's life. This engine of destruction had a
terrifying effect on troops who saw it in operation for the first
time, but the British soldiers defending the trenches at Bullecourt
were seasoned fighters and well acquainted with every type of German
frightfulness.</p>

<p>The Bavarians in this attack succeeded in penetrating the British line
and proceeded to make themselves at home in the position and to
strengthen the defenses. A swift counterattack delivered by the
British killed a number of them, but the others continued to hold on
through the early morning hours. Shortly before noon the snow began to
fall heavily, making observation difficult. Through the storm swept a
body of British troops to assault for a second time. The Bavarians
were taken by surprise and driven out of the position, leaving a score
of prisoners and a number of wounded in British hands. Such minor
operations and small raids made on both sides were the only
interruptions of the quiet that prevailed on the entire front where
General Winter ruled. The troops, who were enduring every discomfort
in their snow-bound trenches, longed eagerly for clearing weather,
when they might find release from deadly inaction.</p>

<p>The British were better off than the Germans, since they had won the
ridges on the front. They could keep dry, while the kaiser's troops
occupied trenches that were often in a fearful condition owing to lack
of natural drainage, which in bad weather transformed them into bogs.
The British took prisoners in dugouts that were filled with water. The
miserable occupants of these holes seemed to be glad enough to fall
into the hands of their enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page074" name="page074"></a>(p. 074)</span> In these days there was considerable relaxation in the iron
discipline of the German army&mdash;on the British front at least. It was
learned that their officers were cautious about punishing the troops
too severely even for grave offenses against discipline. Deserters
were not shot, but sent back to Germany, where it was said the prisons
were full of such offenders. To escape service in the front-line
trenches the soldiers shammed gas-poisoning and resorted to other
devices to avoid duty.</p>

<p>On the French front during these dreary winter days the Germans
continued their raiding attacks in Chaume Wood in the Verdun sector,
and at other points, in which every weapon of "frightfulness,"
including lavish use of liquid fire, was employed. But the French
troops defeated every effort made by the enemy to oust them from the
important positions that had been won by costly sacrifices. These
futile assaults served to keep up their fighting spirit, which
otherwise might have gone down with the mercury.</p>

<p>During the night of January 13, 1918, Canadian troops attacked the
German trenches to the north of Lens. The Germans offered only a
feeble resistance, and after damaging the defenses the Canadians
withdrew, bringing with them a number of prisoners. The adventure was
a success, and almost unique in its way, because the raiders had not
lost a man or suffered a single casualty.</p>

<p>On January 13-14, 1918, during the night and the day following, the
guns of the French and Germans were active at various points along the
Champagne front and on the right bank of the Meuse. In the region
north of Louvemont the Germans had concentrated for attack, when they
came under fire of the French guns and were dispersed. This
discouraged any further attempts of the enemy to launch an infantry
action that day.</p>

<p>On the Alsatian front, between the Thur and Doller Rivers, an
artillery duel was fought all day on January 15, 1918. In the region
of Badonviller the French carried out a successful raid that led to
the capture of forty prisoners including some officers.</p>

<p>During these days peace reigned in a military sense on the British
front in France and Flanders. There was generally, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page075" name="page075"></a>(p. 075)</span> however,
enough going on to keep up interest among the soldiers, even if they
were not called on to do any hard fighting.</p>

<p>German batteries in a fitful way continued to rain a deadly fire
around the outer edge of the Ypres salient from Passchendaele
downward, and scattered shells lavishly among the back areas across
the Menin road and the old fighting grounds of Monchy and Fampoux. The
British troops holding defenses in the suburbs of Lens, Bullecourt,
and Havrincourt were not spared by these destructive visitants.</p>

<p>The British certainly did their part in keeping the Germans at
attention, doing counterbattery work with the aid of aeroplanes
whenever there was an hour or two of visibility, showering tons of
bombs and explosives on German working parties, trenches, and roads.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the boggy condition of the ground, when it was not
deep with snow, a rumor arose, though it was impossible to trace the
source, that the Germans contemplated a great offensive. They
possessed inventive skill and perhaps they would find means to get
their cannon through the swamps of no-man's-land and the roads where
heavy guns would sink wheel deep.</p>

<p>During the night of January 21, 1918, British aviators raided towns in
the occupied parts of Belgium and German Lorraine. Two tons of bombs
were dropped on the steelworks at Thionville, on railway sidings at
Bernstorf, thirty miles south of Metz, and on the Arneville railway
junction.</p>

<p>There was considerable activity on the French front on this date when
German lines west of the Navrain Farm in the Champagne were
successfully raided. The French cut through the enemy defense as far
as the third parallel, and after destroying a trench brought away a
goodly number of dispirited and bedraggled prisoners.</p>

<p>In Belgium during the day there was violent gunfire in the Nieuport
sector. To the east of that place the Germans after a heavy
bombardment made a dashing attack and succeeded in penetrating the
French first-line trenches. They had hardly gained a foothold when the
French rushed a counterattack and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page076" name="page076"></a>(p. 076)</span> drove out the intruders,
who fled to their own lines after losing a considerable number in
wounded and prisoners.</p>

<p>On the right bank of the Meuse the artillery on both sides was active
during January 23, 1918, around that much-fought-over sector, Hill
344, and the front of Chaume Wood. Following up an intense
bombardment, the Germans tried to penetrate the wood, but were
scattered by the French artillery fire.</p>

<p>On the 25th a strong assault was delivered on the French positions
west of St. Gobain Forest. The enemy struck in at the western edge,
and at one time seemed to be in a fair way to succeed, for the attack
lacked neither daring nor persistence, but the French guns, whose fire
had been withheld for a time that the Germans might advance near
enough to present a better target, now poured out such death-dealing
volleys that the attackers were halted and then fled back to their
lines in disorder, leaving many dead on the field.</p>

<p>French aviators were busy on this date as long as there was
visibility. Four German machines were brought down in aerial combats.
Enemy defenses were successfully bombed, and tons of explosives were
dropped on German establishments. Much damage was wrought to the
railway stations at Thionville, and on Freiburg in Breisgau, the
aniline works at Ludwigshafen and the cantonments in the Longuyon
region.</p>

<p>Owing to the military collapse of Russia Germany was enabled to
transfer thirty-eight or forty divisions from east to west, which
meant that the French and British had now facing them at least
3,000,000 enemy troops. A great German offensive was in preparation on
a vaster scale than any before attempted, having for its main object
the capture of Paris or Calais. The Allied command expected the
threatened drive might begin early in February, and had made their
plans accordingly. Confident in their strength, they waited eagerly
the great battle that might end the war.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page077" name="page077"></a>(p. 077)</span> PART II&mdash;THE UNITED STATES AS A BELLIGERENT</h2>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="title">THE NEW ALLY IN COUNCIL</p>


<p>The weight of America's participation in the war did not begin to be
felt until the autumn of 1917, when the aftermath of the Russian
collapse, followed by the Italian disasters, made the Allies turn with
more and more reliance to the new belligerent. Not alone in men,
money, ships, and munitions did the Allies look for American aid, but
for business counsel and administrative efficiency. The war had not
been well conducted. Lloyd George frankly said so. The American mind
was needed at the Allied conferences to contribute its share in
remedying the defects of a division of command, from which had flowed
a succession of costly errors. Hence the United States, being in the
war to join hands with a unified Allied command, not to act
independently, became an influential factor at the war parleys.</p>

<p>The presence of American representatives for the first time at an
Allied war conference in Paris, which took place in November, 1917,
was greeted in belligerent Europe as an event of deep significance.
The United States since its belligerency had not shared in the Allied
deliberations; but the need of unity&mdash;a single front, a single army, a
single nation, as the French Premier, M. Painlevé, defined it&mdash;made
its representation imperative. The delegation, which was headed by
Colonel Edward M. House, and included Admiral Benson and General
Bliss, set out on an avowed war mission while peace balloons floated
in the air. As the President's reputed bosom confidant, who had been
to Europe <span class="pagenum"><a id="page078" name="page078"></a>(p. 078)</span> before on supposed peace missions, Colonel House
was credited with bearing instructions to look over the ground for
practicable peace formulas. His presence among the American
representatives made this impression so general that the State
Department had to deny that he was a Wilson peace envoy. He was
heading a war mission pure and simple whose aim was to weld the United
States firmly as a member of the Allied powers.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Allied conference was to form a more complete
coordination of the activities of the various nations warring against
Germany. A more comprehensive understanding of their respective needs,
in order that their joint efforts attained the highest war efficiency,
was also sought. A prime factor to this end was to avoid any conflict
of interests among the participants.</p>

<p>"The United States," Secretary Lansing explained, "in the employment
of its man power and material resources desires to use them to the
greatest advantage against Germany. It has been no easy problem to
determine how they can be used most effectively, since the independent
presentation of requirements by the Allied Governments have been more
or less conflicting on account of each Government's appreciation of
its own wants, which are naturally given greater importance than the
wants of other governments.</p>

<p>"Though the resources of this country are vast and though there is
every purpose to devote them all, if need be, to winning the war, they
are not without limit. But even if they were greater they should be
used to the highest advantage in attaining the supreme object for
which we are fighting.</p>

<p>"It is the earnest wish of this Government to employ its military and
naval forces and its resources and energies where they will give the
greatest returns in advancing the common cause."</p>

<p>The American Government accordingly was represented at the conference
to determine how this object could be achieved. Primarily the
conferees met to create in effect a great general staff to direct the
energies of the cobelligerents and so motivate military strategy that
entire nations would act merely as units <span class="pagenum"><a id="page079" name="page079"></a>(p. 079)</span> in the operations.
They endeavored to make the whole fighting forces of the Allies into
one mighty war-making machine.</p>

<p>The United States projected as an indispensable bulwark in this scheme
by being practically the treasury and storehouse of the Allies. It had
already poured out money and supplies at their call with lavish hand.
Each had sent a mission to the United States to present its case and
needs. The Government heard them, and the resources of the United
States were freely drawn upon to meet their necessities. Each mission,
however, had confined its requests largely or solely to its own
requirements. Each clamored for men, ships, money, food, munitions, or
whatever other war essential it wanted. A lack of coordinated plans
and predetermined objectives weakened the scope of America's
assistance on account of the scattered and piecemeal methods by which
it was obtained. Consequently the United States, while providing for
its own war necessities, determined that it must have a voice in
arbitrating on the further needs of the Allied nations by weighing
them side by side at the war conference, so that its resources could
be distributed among them in pursuance of a coordinated plan aiming at
achieving collective, not individual, advantage. Germany had pointed
the way in showing the success to be obtained by combined effort.
Germany and her three partners were one. The Allies were many and, so
far, had been disjointed. The entry of the United States became the
occasion for making an endeavor to coalesce the Allies to a closely
knit <i>bloc</i> on the Teutonic method.</p>

<p>Great Britain, momentarily disheartened by the checks the Allied
cause had sustained owing to a division of command and organization,
was braced by the appearance of the American mission at the Allied
conference. Said the London "Times":</p>

<p>"In several points, of late, things have not been going too well for
the Allies, but none of their reverses or disappointments matters if
only the great war power of the United States, military and economic,
is rightly directed to the common end."</p>

<p>"The gain to the Allied cause of the alert American intellect and
American freedom from convention," the "Daily Graphic" said, "should
be of priceless value. Seeing that the guiding <span class="pagenum"><a id="page080" name="page080"></a>(p. 080)</span> principle of
the American delegates is to discover how the resources of their
country can give the greatest results in bringing about the defeat of
Germany, the unanimity of the conference is assured."</p>

<p>"Americans," remarked J. L. Garvin in the London "Observer," "have
less jaded brain cells and more open minds. They are not involved in
any past mistakes or shortcomings. They are uncommitted to any set
theory and are relatively free from local European feelings. Their
moral compass, so to speak, is less exposed to magnetic aberrations
and is more likely to point true. They are in Europe only to win the
war in Europe. They want to get to the bottom of the problem. They
will have all conceivable data for getting to the bottom of it."</p>

<p>The conference found it easier to enunciate a formula than work it out
practically; but at least a beginning was made in forming an
organization to prevent duplication. Leaks of energy were stopped as
well as waste of material. The relations of the Allies one with
another were humanized by personal contact and a good feeling
established which promised a guaranty against future misunderstanding.
The envoys of every nation concerned met with great expectations from
America. On that one subject there was a remarkable unity. All their
needs were generously met, the American resources available being
allocated on the basis of war needs as a whole. But the calls upon the
American barrel were so great that it was tilted at an angle which
revealed that it was not like the purse of Fortunatus.</p>

<p>As to the results of the conference, Colonel House thus reported on
his return to the United States:</p>

<p>"Our mission was a great success. When we left Paris the efforts of
all the Allies were focused. Up to the time of the Allied conferences
they were not focused. They were not working together. They are
working together now, and the promises are that they will continue to
do so."</p>

<p>The principal recommendations made by the American delegation were:</p>

<p>"That the United States exert all their influence to secure the entire
unity of effort, military, naval, and economic, between <span class="pagenum"><a id="page081" name="page081"></a>(p. 081)</span>
themselves and the countries associated with them in the war.</p>

<p>"Inasmuch as the successful termination of the war by the United
States and the Allies can be greatly hastened by the extension of the
United States shipping program, that the Government and the people of
the United States bend every effort toward accomplishing this result
by systematic coordination of resources of men and materials.</p>

<p>"That the fighting forces of the United States be dispatched to Europe
with the least possible delay incident to training and equipment."</p>

<p>Much foundation work was accomplished, covering the entire field of
the war organization, diplomatic, naval, military, finance, shipping,
war trade, war industries and food.</p>

<p>An Interallied Naval Council was formed to coordinate the naval forces
of the United States and those of its associates as one. Embraced in
this scheme were plans for a combined prosecution of the naval war
against the German submarines and keeping the American fleet informed
of the operations and policy of the British Admiralty.</p>

<p>In the military field the extent of the operations of the American
army in Europe was determined, after lengthy conference with the
chiefs of the Allied armies on the western front. All military
resources of the Allied belligerents were to be pooled, the
contribution of each, including the United States, being specified.
The pooling arrangement, according to the State Department,
guaranteed that full equipment would be available to all American
troops sent to Europe during the year 1918. The United States was also
to participate in the deliberations of a Supreme War Council which was
created. The problem of effecting the expeditious debarkation of
American troops and their transport, with the needful equipment, to
the military bases, called for careful survey, and new arrangements to
that end, as well as for the production of military instruments and
supplies, were made.</p>

<p>Consideration of a vital question, that of shipping tonnage, covered a
study of the loss of vessels since the war began, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page082" name="page082"></a>(p. 082)</span>
estimated output of new tonnage in 1918, and the framing of a program
whereby the importations of all the Allies were to be restricted in
order to release a maximum amount of tonnage for the transportation of
American troops.</p>

<p>The United States plainly was not to be a silent partner in the war.
In every sphere of joint action it was to have a voice and a vote.
America was to be represented at a Supreme War Council to determine
the conduct of military operations, at an Interallied Naval Council,
at financial, shipping, and food councils. All that was to be known of
the Allied war situation the American delegates ascertained. They
consulted with the British Cabinet, the British Admiralty, and with
all the Allied Governments; they interviewed chiefs of staff and
commanders in chief, they inspected the fronts. War preparations in
the United States now proceeded with the fullest cognizance of the
conditions they were designed to meet.</p>

<p>The need of American troops in Europe was more than hinted by the
agreement of the Allies to sacrifice importations so that tonnage
could be available to bring the troops across the Atlantic. "Hurry
your men across," Lord Derby urged. Admiral Sir David Beatty and Sir
Auckland Geddes were convinced that the growing American army was
destined to strike the deciding blow of the war. Germany watched the
American preparations with mingled feelings, which could only find
expression in simulated doubt, derision, and scorn. The projects for
raising a huge army, an armada of transport and freight ships, and a
fleet of airships were ridiculed by her press writers as examples of
American bluff and bluster. Americans thought in exaggerations and
talked in superlatives. The United States could not conduct a war in
Europe on any such unexampled scale. Neither troops nor
transports&mdash;supposing the latter could be built, which was
doubtful&mdash;would reach their destination. German submarines would
interpose. Besides, the United States never really intended to make
more than a demonstration. It was merely making a flourish. The
American army was weak any way and that assured its futility as a
factor in the war. It was no better than Rumania's army when that
country entered the war. "The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page083" name="page083"></a>(p. 083)</span> more noise the Americans make,"
the Cologne "Gazette" concluded, "the less they accomplish." That
journal actually informed its readers that the Liberty Loan was a
failure. Field Marshal von Hindenburg saw no importance in the raising
of an American army, because if it were sent abroad Japan might "show
a sudden inclination to square old accounts with America." The
American call to arms suggested "advertising methods" to him. "The
transport question would offer difficulties not less than supplies,"
and, of course, "the German U-boats would be a further obstacle."</p>

<p>The gradual on-coming of the American hosts was otherwise seen by John
St. Loe Strachey, editor of the London "Spectator," who drew this
picture:</p>

<p>"I see America entering upon the field of war as does the shadow in an
eclipse. At first the orb of the moon seems barely touched. There is
only a slight irregularity perceptible on the outline of the sphere,
but gradually the inexorable shadow spreads and spreads till the
crisis of totality is reached; in the words of the Chinese
astrologers, the dragon has eaten the moon.</p>

<p>"What could be more soul-shaking or could bring home the sense of a
force that cannot be denied than the advance of the shadow! Nothing
can hurry it, nothing can delay it, nothing can avert it. The process
is begun; the doom will be accomplished.</p>

<p>"So be it, so it must be, so it will be with America and Germany in
1918."</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="title">ON THE LORRAINE FRONT</p>


<p>The American expeditionary force in France were still in process of
being "broken in" when the war entered upon its fourth year. They
remained well behind the firing lines in their training camp,
continuing their education in trench warfare. The manipulation of the
hand grenade, rifle, bayonet, trench mortar, and machine gun under
conditions to which the British <span class="pagenum"><a id="page084" name="page084"></a>(p. 084)</span> and French had long been
inured, and, most irksome and unpopular task of all, trench digging,
formed the order of the day. Contingents gradually progressed toward
the stage closely approximating real warfare by undergoing the ordeal
of "gassing" in order to be equal to the quick adjustment of masks
when gas shells were fired in action. Other companies found their way
behind the British lines to drill their nerves to withstand scenes of
ruin and desolation, the whine of high-explosive shells, and the
rattle of shrapnel. All these preliminaries were directed toward a
modest aim&mdash;storming a trench line. Formerly troops were trained for
undertaking rapid marches and complicated maneuvers. In this war their
endurance and fighting spirit became restricted to a narrow
field&mdash;that of penetrating enemy lines on a front of ten kilometers,
whose depth did not extend beyond one kilometer.</p>

<p>The American troops did not take kindly to "digging in." Their
officers found great difficulty in impressing them with the importance
of taking cover. They were like their Canadian brothers-in-arms, of
whom it was said that they would die in the last ditch but never dig
it. They were averse to submitting to the unheroic obligation of
learning to fight in ambush; they clung to primitive ideas of warfare
and wanted to spring upon and charge the enemy in the open. Only
bitter losses finally persuaded the Canadians, French, and Australians
that fighting the Germans from a hole in the ground was the only way
of fighting them at all; but the Americans had yet to pay their toll
for yielding to their natural antipathy to fighting underground.
Their zeal for the pick and shovel, despite the war's terrible object
lessons, remained lukewarm.</p>

<p>"It seems a shame to curb the fine fighting spirits of our troops," an
American training officer said; "but they must be made to understand
as far as possible that impetuosity must be subordinated to
steadiness. This has become a time-clock war. The men must advance in
given time and go no further. Every step of infantry advance must
first be worked out with the artillery, and when the plan is arranged
it must be strictly adhered to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page085" name="page085"></a>(p. 085)</span> "We realize that it will be difficult to hold our men to this
plan. If they see a battle going on, their favorite impulse will be to
push on as fast as they can, and some are bound to do so, just as the
Canadians did in the earlier stages. We will undoubtedly have big
losses in this way, but the men who come through our first battles
will be worth their weight in gold thereafter. They will learn quickly
the value of steadiness and absolute discipline under fire, and they
will be the steadying influence we can distribute through the newer
units of our great army as they get their final preparation for trial
by fire."</p>

<p>More to their taste was the training practice of charging dummy
Germans in specially prepared trenches under the direction of an
English sergeant major. At one camp three short lines of such trenches
were constructed in a dip in the ground, ending at a rise some hundred
yards off, with tin cans on sticks dotting them. The charge was thus
undertaken:</p>

<p>"'Ready, gentlemen,' said the drill sergeant. 'Prepare for trench
bayonet practice by half sections. You're to take these three line of
trenches, lay out every boche in the lot, and then get to cover and
fire six rounds at them 'ere tin 'ats. Don't waste a shot, gentlemen;
every bullet a boche. Now, then, ready! Over the top and give 'em 'ell
right in the stomach! Fritz likes his victuals, but not that sort. Get
at 'em!'"</p>

<p>The men ran some ten yards and dug their bayonets savagely into dummy
Germans made of sacks, which swung in the wind, and disappeared in the
first trench. Their rifle butts rose and fell as they lunged
desperately at the supposed foe. Then they reappeared and advanced
farther, taking cover and lying spread-eagled behind a shallow trench,
blazing at the cans, which fell rattling.</p>

<p>After some four months' training in camp, the long-looked-for tidings
that American troops had taken their place beside the fighting forces
of the Allies at length came from General Pershing's headquarters. On
October 27, 1917, the first official announcement of war news from
that source was issued in this form:</p>

<p>"In continuation of their training as a nucleus for instruction later,
a contingent of some battalions of our first contingents, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page086" name="page086"></a>(p. 086)</span> in
association with veteran French battalions, are in the first-line
trenches of a quiet sector on the French front. They are supported by
some batteries of our artillery, in association with veteran French
batteries.</p>

<p>"The sector remains normal. Our men have adapted themselves to actual
trench conditions in the most satisfactory manner."</p>

<p>The "quiet sector" was occupied by helmeted infantry of the United
States, without the knowledge of the enemy, by arriving at night
through pouring rain and seas of mud. At six o'clock on the morning of
that day, American artillery, already installed, fired the first
American shot of the war at the German working party and shelled the
German positions. The Germans gave shell for shell. The fusillades
continued all day.</p>

<p>During the lull in the firing at dusk the first American machine guns
appeared in a little deserted, shell-wrecked village well within
hostile gun range and a few kilometers from the American trenches. The
guns were hauled by Missouri mules, whose drivers were swathed in
ponchos and helmeted to their eyes. The cavalcade moved in a long,
silent line along a road margining a dark canal, followed by infantry
rolling camp kitchens.</p>

<p>Other infantry followed through the cobble-paved streets. The darkness
hid lines of men with packs on their backs, rifles slung on their
shoulders, rain glistening on their helmets and coats, the wind
whipping their coat skirts round limbs moving with machinelike
precision. Only the tramp of many hobnailed boots disclosed their
march through the village. They safely entered their trenches, unit by
unit, and passed quickly to the places assigned them. The French
welcomed them with ardor. Every American was shaken by the hand, some
were hugged, and even kissed on both cheeks in the French custom.
Quietness was essential, since the German trenches were not far away;
but the fervor of the French troops overcame their precaution. It was
too great a day for mute welcomes. The Americans had arrived!</p>

<p class="smcap">The American front in France where the first clashes
between Americans and Germans occurred.</p>
</div>

<p>The trenches were found to be muddy but well constructed. The troops
settled down in them, and at daylight, under low-hanging, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page088" name="page088"></a>(p. 088)</span>
dripping clouds, they obtained their first view of the German lines,
stretching away in the rolling terrain. They were in contact with the
enemy at last.</p>

<p>They received their baptism of fire mingled with showers of mud, their
clothes soaked to the skin. American shells fell and exploded in
German territory, and German projectiles broke near the American
positions, sprinkling fragments, but doing no serious damage. They
were merely establishing contact as a prelude to more serious
operations. Gunners and infantrymen alike, the latter in first-line
trenches, over which both American and German shells whizzed, were
satisfied, though wet, feeling that the distinction of being the first
Americans to be in action more than recompensed for weather
discomforts.</p>

<p>Their first quarry was a stray German mail carrier who had lost his
way in the dark and was taken prisoner near the American trenches. He
encountered an American patrol in no-man's-land in company with
another German, and was shot while running away after refusing to
halt.</p>

<p>While waiting for a real attack sniping engaged the troops' attention,
especially on clear days, when German snipers sought targets. Many
bullets passed singing harmlessly overhead. Their frequency called for
retorts, and a number of infantrymen were detailed to single out the
snipers. Sniping the sniper became part of the preliminaries of
settling down to trench warfare.</p>

<p>The troops realized by these activities, trifling though they were,
that mimic charges and class-room demonstrations of the training camp
were things of the past and that they faced the real foe. The Germans
in fact, were not tardy in impressing them with their new situation.
They discovered that Americans were facing them and set about making a
raid. Berlin announced the result in a brief bulletin on November 3.</p>

<p>"At the Rhine-Marne Canal, as the result of a reconnoitering thrust,
North American soldiers were brought in as prisoners."</p>

<p>The news brought the American people a step nearer to a realization of
the actualities of the great struggle. It also disclosed that the
Americans were established on a section of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page089" name="page089"></a>(p. 089)</span> front defended
by the German Crown Prince's army and facing Lorraine. The so-called
"quiet sector" stood revealed as the only front through which war
could be carried into the heart of Germany. It lay before the gap in
the French barrier forts, Verdun-Toul and Epinal-Belfort, flanked by
the invulnerable Verdun on the northeast and the French positions in
the Alsatian Vosges on the southeast. A quiet sector it might be, but
more than 40,000 German dead lie buried there, the flower of the army
of the Crown Prince of Bavaria. They fell in a twenty-eight day battle
in August and September, 1914, when five French army corps under
General Castelnau fought seven under the Crown Prince The Germans
finally retired into Lorraine after vainly attempting to cross the
Moselle. Both General Pétain&mdash;who attempted an offensive there in
1916, but was checked from proceeding with it by political high
commands&mdash;and General Castelnau were convinced of the vulnerability of
this sector as a roadway into Germany, and prophets were not wanting
who saw in the presence of the Americans there a foretoken that an
American army might essay what the two French Generals had not
accomplished. At any rate, after an unbroken calm of three years, the
sector was no longer quiet.</p>

<p>The Germans had scored by drawing first blood. The Berlin press was
riotously gleeful over the event, one journal, the "Lokal-Anzeiger,"
gloating over it in these terms:</p>

<p>"Three cheers for the Americans! Clever chaps they are, it cannot be
denied. Scarcely have they touched the soil of this putrefied Europe
when they already are forcing their way into Germany.</p>

<p>"It is our good fortune that we are equipped to receive and entertain
numerous guests and that we shall be able to provide quarters for
these gentlemen. They will find comfort in the thought that they are
rendering their almighty President, Mr. Wilson, valuable services,
inasmuch as it is asserted he is anxious to obtain reliable
information concerning conditions and sentiments in belligerent
countries.</p>

<p>"As Americans are accustomed to travel in luxury and comfort, we
assume that these advance arrivals merely represent <span class="pagenum"><a id="page090" name="page090"></a>(p. 090)</span> couriers
for larger numbers to come. We are sure the latter will come and be
gathered in by us. At home they believe they possess the biggest and
most colossal everything, but such establishments as we have here they
have not seen.</p>

<p>"Look here, my boy, here is the big firm of Hindenburg &amp; Co., with
which you want to compete. Look at its accomplishments and consider
whether it would not be better to haul down your sign and engage in
some other line. Perhaps your boss, Wilson, will reconsider his newest
line of business before we grab off more of his young people."</p>

<p>A salient of the American position occupied by a small detachment had
been successfully raided by the Germans before daybreak, resulting in
three Americans killed, several wounded, and a dozen captured or
missing. The Teutons started a heavy barrage fire, which isolated the
salient, so that help could not reach the troops, nor could they
retire, and thus had the besieged men at the mercy of their superior
force. The Americans fought obstinately until they were overwhelmed.
They had only been in the trenches a few days and were part of the
second contingent who had entered them for training under actual war
conditions. They succeeded in capturing a German prisoner, and
inflicting casualties; but the latter did not become known as the
enemy, in fleeing the trench, took their dead and wounded with them.</p>

<p>After shelling the barbed-wire front of the trenches, dropping many
high-explosive missiles of large caliber, the Germans directed a heavy
artillery fire to cover all the adjacent territory, including the
passage leading to the trenches, thereby effecting a complete barrage
of the salient front and rear. Soon after the enemy, exceeding two
hundred in number, rushed the breaches and wire entanglements on each
side of the salient, lifting the barrage in the forefield to permit
their passage.</p>

<p>It was an elaborate encircling bombardment to achieve a trifling
object. An American platoon, numbering only nineteen men, were
corraled by a heavy fire from 77's and 115's, which searched the whole
line of trenches communicating with the salient where they were
isolated. The French, who had only <span class="pagenum"><a id="page091" name="page091"></a>(p. 091)</span> recently vacated the
position to make way for the Americans, estimated that the German
shells expended exceeded eight thousand.</p>

<p>With the raising of the frontal barrage, the German raiders advanced.
They were composed of storm troops, volunteers, machine gunners,
artillerymen, pioneers to destroy the wire entanglements, and
stretcher bearers to carry off their casualties. They had gathered
round a group of ruined farm buildings some seven hundred yards from
the American trenches, armed with grenades, revolvers, trench knives,
and rifles. They followed, in columns of fours, a tape across
no-man's-land laid out by leaders who had previously been over the
ground. Advancing across a swampy ravine toward the salient, they
penetrated the gaps in the American wire entanglements, and a number
reached the trenches at the rear of their barrage. The Americans were
thus cut off from behind. Other raiders stayed outside the trenches to
protect those who entered them and to shoot any Americans who appeared
above the parapet. The trenches were stormed right and left of the
salient, one party clearing them as they proceeded, the other invading
the dugouts for prisoners.</p>

<p>The darkness of the trenches veiled what next happened. After the
Germans had completed their work and retired, an American trooper,
private Enright, was found with his throat cut from ear to ear on the
top of the parapet. While fighting a German in front of him he
appeared to have been attacked from behind by another armed with a
trench knife. A second trooper, private Hay, lay dead in the trench,
and outside a dugout was the body of Corporal Gresham.</p>

<p>In the confusion some of the American troops mistook the Germans for
their own comrades, and paid for their error. Corporal Gresham, for
example, was the sentry at a dugout door when three men advanced
toward him. Supposing them to be Americans he shouted:</p>

<p>"Don't shoot! I'm an American."</p>

<p>"It's Americans we're looking for," answered one of the three, and
shot him dead with a revolver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page092" name="page092"></a>(p. 092)</span> It was a brief, ordinary affray, in nowise different from
other happenings occurring nightly all along the front. But nineteen
Americans were set upon by over 200 Germans, and it was the Americans'
first taste of Teutonic warfare. They fought stoutly with pistols,
knives, and bayonets until overcome, whereupon the Germans went off
with an American sergeant, a corporal, and ten privates, all of whom
were trapped in a dugout near the tip of the besieged salient.</p>

<p>The raid scarcely lasted five minutes and outside the salient no one
in the American lines knew it was proceeding. The German communiqué
dismissed it in three lines. From Berlin's viewpoint it was
inconsequential; but to Americans it was of moment in being their
first clash with the enemy. Young, inexperienced soldiers, cooped in a
position they were not familiar with, encountering their baptism of
fire under circumstances of surprise, uncertainty, and darkness, had
acquitted themselves well against heavy odds, and prevented the enemy
from penetrating beyond the first line of trenches.</p>

<p>The American dead were buried with due honors on French soil. The
general commanding the French division in the section delivered an
oration at their graves in the presence of French and American troops
amid the roaring of guns and whistle of shells. His words belong to
the record of America's part in the war:</p>

<p>"Men! These graves, first to be dug in our national soil, and but a
short distance from the enemy, are as a mark of the mighty land we and
our allies firmly cling to in the common task, confirming the will of
the people and the army of the United States to fight with us to a
finish, ready to sacrifice as long as is necessary until final victory
for the most noble of causes, that of the liberty of nations, the weak
as well as the mighty. Thus the deaths of these humble soldiers appear
to us with extraordinary grandeur.</p>

<p>"We will, therefore, ask that the mortal remains of these young men be
left here, left with us forever. We inscribe on the tombs, 'Here lie
the first soldiers of the Republic of the United States to fall on the
soil of France for liberty and justice.' <span class="pagenum"><a id="page093" name="page093"></a>(p. 093)</span> The passer-by will
stop and uncover his head. Travelers and men of heart will go out of
their way to come here to pay their respective tributes.</p>

<p>"Private Enright, Private Gresham, Private Hay! In the name of France
I thank you. God receive your souls. Farewell!"</p>

<p>After this foray shelling became of daily occurrence. The troops
continued their training under fire, the first contingent giving place
to the second contingent, and the second to the third in occupying the
trenches, after each had undergone a spell of patrol work,
sharpshooting, and accustoming their nerves to falling shrapnel.
Trench conditions enabled them to acquire a better insight of the
science of war than they could learn in months of instruction in
training camps. While the infantry were thus engaged in their
underground finishing school, the gunners, in addition to making
progress in actual firing, acquired greater facility in observation
work and in locating enemy batteries by the sound method. The heavy
guns on both sides engaged in duels at long range, with the lighter
pieces working at targets nearer the lines. This gun activity was not
without its toll. German casualties due to American marksmanship, of
course, could not be ascertained, but they were probably equal to the
American killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The troops were eager for an opportunity to retaliate on the foe for
trapping their comrades in the salient, and on November 14, 1917, a
patrol succeeded in exacting a partial revenge. Assisted by some
French troops they planned a night ambuscade near the German lines on
a shell-ruined farm. It was a dreary vigil in the mud, where they lay
throughout the small hours, until their patience was rewarded by the
appearance of a large German patrol, in number more than double those
of the Franco-Americans. They permitted the Germans to pass, and then
attacked them on their flank. The fusillade of French and American
bullets from shell craters and other shelters where the sharpshooters
lay concealed took the Germans by surprise. They precipitately fled,
taking their fallen with them. No French or American trooper was hit
by the shots the Germans fired in their hurried retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page094" name="page094"></a>(p. 094)</span> More notable than such skirmishes on the American front
before Lorraine was the part a number of unarmed American engineers,
in company with Canadians, took in the encircling movement the Germans
made on the British positions before Cambrai on November 30, 1917. For
some time past American engineers had not only been of yeoman service
behind the French lines in hauling tons of ammunition and other
equipment to supply the French forces, but had been engaged on the
railroad in the rear of the British front. They did not belong to the
fighting units, and no achievements were looked for from men whose
sole arms were picks and shovels. But the ramifications of the German
assault on Gouzeaucourt brought these workers in the rear to the
forefront of the attack, and they distinguished themselves in a manner
which drew tributes from both the French and British high commands. A
staid official account of the rôle they played thus describes the
situation:</p>

<p>"Two and one-half companies of railway engineers, with a strength of
eight officers and 365 men, were encamped at Fins on November 30,
1917, having completed their work in the neighborhood. At 6.30 four
officers and 280 men went to Gouzeaucourt, arriving at 7 and starting
to work with Canadian engineers. The entire contingent was under a
Canadian major and an American captain. The area was three miles in
the rear of the line and none of the troops was armed.</p>

<p>"At 7.15 German barrage fire moved on Gouzeaucourt after heavy
shelling to the east. At 7.30 a general retirement was ordered, and
it was effected with some difficulty, due to the artillery,
machine-gun and airplane fire.</p>

<p>"A number of losses were sustained at this time, and also among the
men who, cut off by the German advance, had taken refuge in dugouts.
Some of these men who had been cut off succeeded in joining British
combatant units and fought with them during the day."</p>

<p>A story of American grit and pluck lay concealed in the last sentence.
The American and Canadian engineers, cut off as described, were taken
prisoners by the Germans. They were fifty in number, and accompanied
by a German escort marched along <span class="pagenum"><a id="page095" name="page095"></a>(p. 095)</span> the road leading from
Gouzeaucourt to Cambrai. As they proceeded disconsolately toward the
zone of the German prison cages, they encountered a small body of
British troops who had been separated from their comrades and were
wandering about aimlessly. The appearance of the Germans with the
prisoners produced an immediate charge toward them by the British. The
Germans sought to drive their captives toward La Vacquerie before the
advancing British reached them. But the prisoners, seeing rescue at
hand, turned upon their guards and fought them barehanded until the
British troops interposed and vanquished the Germans. The American
engineers and their comrades thereupon took possession of the German
rifles and with their rescuers found their way back to the British
lines.</p>

<p>A number of American engineers were killed and injured, presumably
during the German attack on Gouzeaucourt, since no mention was made of
casualties in the adventure on the highroad. Their losses were largely
due to their being unarmed when the Germans came, a predicament which
forced them to seize the guns of dead and wounded soldiers to protect
themselves. The army commands afterward ordered that all engineers be
armed to enable them to take their place with the troops in any future
emergency which brought them again face to face with the foe. The
French Government was so impressed with their performance that it sent
the following communication to Washington:</p>

<p>"We must remark upon the conduct of certain American soldiers,
pioneers and workmen on the military railroad in the sector of the
German attack west of Cambrai on November 30, 1917. They exchanged
their picks and shovels for rifles and cartridges and fought with the
English. Many died thus bravely, arms in hand, before the invader. All
helped to repulse the enemy. There is not a single person who saw them
at work who does not render warm praise to the coolness, discipline,
and courage of these improvised combatants."</p>

<p>Their exploit stirred the American camp to enthusiasm mingled with
envy. The British front at Cambrai was a long step from the American
trenches in the Lorraine sector, and tidings <span class="pagenum"><a id="page096" name="page096"></a>(p. 096)</span> of the
happenings at Gouzeaucourt impressed the troops with the fact that not
on them only was the glory of the Stars and Stripes being upheld on
the soil of France. An infantry sergeant voiced the general feeling of
his comrades thus:</p>

<p>"We stay in the trenches for a spell and let Fritz shoot his artillery
at us and have never really had a chance to use our rifles except to
snipe and pot Fritz out in no-man's-land on dark nights. These
railroaders managed to run their trains right into a good, thick
scrap, and if this isn't luck, I don't know what it is."</p>

<p>Casualties continued to grow with the constant shelling. Sporadic
raids over no-man's-land and visitations of German airships added to
them. Bombs were dropped on a party of engineers, killing one of them,
and two privates were victims of a German aviator's explosive over a
wood in which they were camped.</p>

<p>Winter set in with a snowfall that impeded the training of the troops
and communications. Roads became impassable by drifts, and many motor
trucks, after crawling at a snail's pace over the hilly roads, became
stranded in the snow. A thaw in January turned icy roads into river
beds. Torrential streams flowed from melting snows in the hills, and
together with a downpour of fine rain combined to make weather
conditions on the American front the worst the troops had encountered
since their arrival in France. The roads were cluttered in places with
ditched motor trucks. Here and there mule-drawn vehicles were mired.
Transport trains drawn by mules suffered most before the thaw, the
animals slipping and falling on the icy roadbeds, and were unable to
rise except by the aid of thick layers of branches and twigs placed
under their hoofs. The beginning of 1918, in short, found the American
army in France, like their allied comrades on the rest of the front,
stalled by the weather, and little tidings came of their accustomed
activities.</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page097" name="page097"></a>(p. 097)</span> CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="title">POPE AND PRESIDENT</p>


<p>Peace efforts, assiduously pursued in Berlin, and culminating in the
Reichstag resolution recorded in the previous volume, had meantime
taken a new turn; but they encountered a new element in the United
States as a resolute belligerent.</p>

<p>The Vatican interposed with an olive branch. The Pope tread
cautiously, sensible of the delicacy of his task in seeking to effect
world peace; but his proposals were hopelessly futile and died in the
borning. Their only welcome came from the Central Powers, and even
there dissentient voices were heard. The Allies' reception of his note
was cold, unresponsive, suspicious, and resentful. "As you were," the
Pope virtually proposed to the two groups of belligerents, running
directly counter to the chief aim of the Allies, which was to overturn
the <i>status quo ante</i>, and establish a European concert of nations on
a new, safer, and enduring foundation.</p>

<p>The Papal note, communicated to the various belligerent powers on
August 1, 1917, invited their governments to agree on the following
points, which seemed to his Holiness, "to offer the basis of a just
and lasting peace":</p>

<p>"First, the fundamental point must be that the material force of arms
shall give way to the moral force of right, whence shall proceed a
just agreement of all upon the simultaneous and reciprocal decrease of
armaments, according to rules and guarantees to be established, in the
necessary and sufficient measure for the maintenance of public order
in every State; then, taking the place of arms, the institution of
arbitration, with its high pacifying function, according to rules to
be drawn in concert and under sanctions to be determined against any
State which would decline either to refer international questions to
arbitration or to accept its awards.</p>

<p>"When supremacy of right is thus established, let every obstacle to
ways of communication of the peoples be removed by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page098" name="page098"></a>(p. 098)</span> insuring,
through rules to be also determined, the true freedom and community of
the seas, which, on the one hand, would eliminate any causes of
conflict, and on the other hand, would open to all new sources of
prosperity and progress.</p>

<p>"As for the damages to be repaid and the cost of the war, we see no
other way of solving the question than by setting up the general
principle of entire and reciprocal conditions, which would be
justified by the immense benefit to be derived from disarmament, all
the more as one could not understand that such carnage could go on for
mere economic reasons. If certain particular reasons stand against
this in certain cases, let them be weighed in justice and equity.</p>

<p>"But these specific agreements, with the immense advantages that flow
from them, are not possible unless territory now occupied is
reciprocally restituted. Therefore, on the part of Germany, there
should be total evacuation of Belgium, with guaranties of its entire
political, military, and economic independence toward any power
whatever; evacuation also of the French territory; on the part of the
other belligerents, a similar restitution of the German colonies.</p>

<p>"As regards territorial questions, as, for instance, those that are
disputed by Italy and Austria, by Germany and France, there is reason
to hope that, in consideration of the immense advantages of durable
peace with disarmament, the contending parties will examine them in a
conciliatory spirit, taking into account, as far as is just and
possible, as we have said formerly, the aspirations of the
population, and, if occasion arises, adjusting private interests to
the general good of the great human society.</p>

<p>"The same spirit of equity and justice must guide the examination of
the other territorial and political questions, notably those relative
to Armenia, the Balkan States, and the territories forming part of the
old Kingdom of Poland, for which, in particular, its noble historical
traditions and suffering, particularly undergone in the present war,
must win with justice, the sympathies of the nations."</p>

<p>The deep esteem in which the Allies and the rest of the nations held
the Pontiff assured an attentive and respectful hearing of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page099" name="page099"></a>(p. 099)</span>
his appeal. But his intervention was nevertheless denounced as an
espousal of a German peace, in that it would enable Germany to take
her place at the peace council table with all her lost colonies
restored, exempt from every demand for reparation for the ruin she had
wrought, secure in the possession of all her territory, and with the
future of Alsace-Lorraine, Trent, Trieste, Poland, Rumania, and Serbia
left for settlement by negotiation by the parties in conflict. The
Papal proposals were also objected to in making no distinction between
the combatants, but placed them all on the same footing as apparently
"stricken by a universal madness."</p>

<p>It soon became apparent that the Allied Powers, including the United
States, were a unit in agreeing that the Papal note, because it
overlooked the issues for which the Entente was fighting, must be
respectfully rejected. President Wilson became their spokesman in a
note he addressed to the Pontiff on August 27, 1917. While recognizing
the Pope's "moving appeal" and the "dignity and force of the humane
motives which prompted it," the President considered it would be folly
to take the path of peace the Pope pointed out if that path did not in
fact lead to the goal proposed. As to the Pope's proposals generally,
he said:</p>

<p>"It is manifest that no part of this program can be successfully
carried out unless the restitution of the <i>status quo ante</i> furnishes
a firm and satisfactory basis for it. The object of this war is to
deliver the free peoples of the world from the menace and the actual
power of a vast military establishment, controlled by an irresponsible
Government, which, having secretly planned to dominate the world,
proceeded to carry the plan out without regard either to the sacred
obligations of treaty or the long-established practices and
long-cherished principles of international action and honor; which
chose its own time for the war; delivered its blow fiercely and
suddenly; stopped at no barrier, either of law or of mercy; swept a
whole continent within the tide of blood&mdash;not the blood of soldiers
only, but the blood of innocent women and children also and of the
helpless poor; and now stands balked, but not defeated, the enemy of
four-fifths of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span> "This power is not the German people. It is the ruthless
master of the German people. It is no business of ours how that great
people came under its control or submitted with temporary zest to the
domination of its purpose; but it is our business to see to it that
the history of the rest of the world is no longer left to its
handling.</p>

<p>"To deal with such a power by way of peace upon the plan proposed by
his Holiness, the Pope, would, so far as we can see, involve a
recuperation of its strength and a renewal of its policy; would make
it necessary to create a permanent hostile combination of nations
against the German people, who are its instruments; and would result
in abandoning the newborn Russia to the intrigue, the manifold subtle
interference, and the certain counter-revolution which would be
attempted by all the malign influences to which the German Government
has of late accustomed the world.</p>

<p>"We cannot take the word of the present rulers of Germany as a
guaranty of anything that is to endure unless explicitly supported by
such conclusive evidence of the will and purpose of the German people
themselves as the other peoples of the world would be justified in
accepting. Without such guaranties treaties of settlement, agreements
for disarmament, covenants to set up arbitration in the place of
force, territorial adjustments, reconstitutions of small nations, if
made with the German Government, no man, no nation, could now depend
on.</p>

<p>"We must await some new evidence of the purposes of the great peoples
of the Central Powers."</p>

<p>In other words, the Pope's proposals were regarded as untenable
because the Allies could not trust the kaiser and his government to
respect any covenants that might flow from them. There was no
responsible person to negotiate with. The Vatican was disappointed,
the German press greeted the President's answer with abuse, and the
Allies found the American note so comprehensive and satisfying in
expressing their views that they paid no further attention to the
proposal.</p>

<p>Germany and Austria were more responsive; but the Allies' rejection
through President Wilson of the papal suggestions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>(p. 101)</span> imparted
something of an anticlimax to the Teutonic replies when they were
forthcoming a month later. Both reflected an earnest desire for peace;
both gave whole-hearted support to the Vatican's efforts. Austria was
especially eager to enter into negotiations on the basis the Pope
proposed. But neither was specific. The Austrian emperor favored
disarmament and arbitration in a cloud of platitudes. The kaiser
accepted the Pope's general aims, but was mute on particularizing the
German aims. Both suppressed whatever terms of peace they longed to
offer. Sifted down to essentials, and extricating their meaning from a
welter of unctuous verbiage, the Teutonic answers merely conveyed an
eager desire to reach a peace conference, withholding terms for
submission until such parleys could begin. As each evaded any
suggestion of definite concessions on vital points, the absence of
which constituted the principal obstacles to peace, and as the Allies
had already refused to negotiate with the German Government in any
event, the Teutonic answers lost all significance except as diplomatic
courtesies in response to the Pope's well-meant mediation. That was
probably their main purpose.</p>

<p>Germany proposed nothing except that the war be ended by a promise on
her part to reduce her army reciprocally with other nations&mdash;a promise
she would not fulfill; by a promise that Great Britain reduce her
navy&mdash;a promise she would expect Great Britain faithfully to fulfill;
and a promise of the nations to arbitrate in future&mdash;a promise
Germany would ignore if conditions favored a new war. She saw "the
freedom of the seas" as the issue of the war; but the seas were as
free to Germany in time of peace as they were to Great Britain, their
reputed mistress. The rest of the world saw the German Government as
the real issue of the war.</p>

<p>The next peace manifestation, which caused a momentary disturbance in
Allied circles, came from the Marquis of Lansdowne, a former British
Foreign Secretary, who had also been Viceroy of India and Governor
General of Canada. Fearing that the prolongation of the war might lead
to "the ruin of the civilized world," he besought the Allies to make a
restatement <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>(p. 102)</span> of their war aims in order to bring about peace
before that catastrophe came.</p>

<p>The Lansdowne communication to the press looked like a plea for
Germany, and coming as it did from a British noble of ingrained
toryism, who had done his share as a Cabinet Minister to develop
British imperialism, was startling enough. To forestall any suspicion
that he was voicing unofficial sentiments of the British Government,
Bonar Law and Lord Robert Cecil declared that Lord Lansdowne only
spoke his own views. The Government repudiated them, as did the
Unionist party. Lord Lansdowne himself was obliged to acknowledge that
his proposals were solely his own and that he consulted no one in
formulating them. It was realized that his note only encouraged the
German war party, which construed it as evidence of divided counsels
in Great Britain, and that the British were weakening in their
determination to conquer. The air was quickly cleared and showed that
no peace movement was possible in England while Germany remained
impenitent and unbeaten.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="title">AMERICA'S WAR AIMS</p>


<p>Nevertheless, the Papal and Lansdowne letters were not entirely
fruitless. It brought the Allies a step nearer to restating their war
aims through Lloyd-George and President Wilson. But their utterances
pointed to a steadfast continuance of the war until those aims were
achieved, not a slackening of hostilities to effect an inconclusive
peace lenient to Germany.</p>

<p>Addressing a body of trades-union delegates at Westminster on January
5, 1918, the British Premier faced a situation&mdash;an apparent outgrowth
of the Lansdowne letter&mdash;where national unity in the prosecution of
the war was perceived to be in jeopardy. A suspicion was rife that the
war was being pursued <span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>(p. 103)</span> for objects which could not be openly
avowed. Lloyd-George therefore saw the need of a restatement of war
aims:</p>

<p>"We may begin by clearing away some misunderstandings and stating what
we are not fighting for.</p>

<p>"We are not fighting a war of aggression against the German people.
Their leaders have persuaded them that they are fighting a war of
self-defense against a league of rival nations, bent on the
destruction of Germany. That is not so. The destruction or disruption
of Germany or the German people has never been a war aim with us from
the first day of this war to this day.</p>

<p>"Nor did we enter this war merely to alter or destroy the imperial
constitution of Germany, much as we consider that military and
autocratic constitution a dangerous anachronism in the twentieth
century. Our point of view is that the adoption of a really democratic
constitution by Germany would be the most convincing evidence that her
old spirit of military domination has, indeed, died in this war and
would make it much easier for us to conclude a broad, democratic peace
with her. But, after all, that is a question for the German people to
decide.</p>

<p>"We are not fighting to destroy Austria-Hungary or to deprive Turkey
of its capital or the rich lands of Asia Minor and Thrace, which are
predominantly Turkish.</p>

<p>"The settlement of the new Europe must be based on such grounds of
reason and justice as will give some promise of stability. Therefore,
it is that we feel that government with the consent of the governed
must be the basis of any territorial settlement in this war. For that
reason also, unless treaties be upheld, unless every nation is
prepared, at whatever sacrifices, to honor the national signature, it
is obvious that no treaty of peace can be worth the paper on which it
is written."</p>

<p>The British Premier then restated the Allies' specific war aims, which
did not materially differ from the first declaration recorded in a
previous volume of this history, except with regard to Russia,
conditions in that country having called for a suspension of judgment
on territorial questions affecting her.</p>

<p>Three days later (January 8, 1918), President Wilson gave to the world
the peace terms of the United States in an address to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span>
Congress. His declaration was the most advanced doctrine of
internationalism pronounced by any of the Allied statesmen. It
definitely committed the United States not only to promoting and
safeguarding the peace of Europe but the peace of the world. The
frequent question: What was America fighting for? was answered. It was
not merely to uphold American rights. The aims of the United States
had developed far beyond nationalism. It was to uphold the rights of
all the peoples menaced or outraged in the world war.</p>

<p>The purpose of the President's address appeared to be threefold:</p>

<p>To drive a wedge into the political structure of Germany by
encouraging the Socialists and liberal elements, and exhibiting the
military party as the single obstacle to democracy and world peace.</p>

<p>To expose the insincerity of Germany's pretensions of liberality in
her peace offers to Russia and thus bring Russia back into partnership
with the democracy of the Allies, which she showed symptoms of
abandoning.</p>

<p>To show the agreement of the United States with the speech of
Lloyd-George and to develop further the principles of world peace for
which America stood.</p>

<p>The Entente Allies welcomed the President's pronouncement as putting
the seal of American approval on their war aims, as reiterated by
Lloyd-George, and as committing the United States to the Allied cause
till it was won. The necessity for any restatement of war aims by the
United States was regarded as a question for the President to
determine, and he had done so at a time when the need was clearly
urgent in Great Britain. Hence his address, echoing and, indeed,
amplifying that of Lloyd-George, buttressed British solidarity on the
war by definitely establishing an abiding Anglo-American Entente while
the war lasted.</p>

<p>Far from opening a way to peace, the Papal and Lansdowne pleas
produced a sequence of utterances which were in effect renewed war
declarations from the spokesmen of the Allies. Lord Lansdowne sought a
reiteration of war aims as a basis for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>(p. 105)</span> peace negotiations.
President Wilson's answer to that suggestion was not confined to a
reassertion of America's war objects. While the dove of peace was
fluttering a pair of weak wings he went to Congress (December 4, 1917)
and called for war against Austria-Hungary to remove an "embarrassing
obstacle" in the conduct of hostilities against Germany.</p>

<p>"Austria-Hungary," he told Congress, "is for the time being not her
own mistress, but simply the vassal of the German Government. We must
face the facts as they are and act upon them without sentiment in this
stern business.</p>

<p>"The Government of Austria-Hungary is not acting upon its own
initiative or in response to the wishes and feelings of its own
peoples, but as the instrument of another nation. We must meet its
force with our own and regard the Central Powers as but one. The war
can be successfully conducted in no other way. The same logic would
lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria. They
also are the tools of Germany. But they are mere tools and do not yet
stand in the direct path of our necessary action."</p>

<p>Both branches of Congress responded by passing a joint war resolution
with only one dissentient House vote, and on December 7, 1917, war
with Austria-Hungary was declared.</p>

<p>Germany meditated. There was an answer to be made to Lloyd-George and
President Wilson, but what? The military situation, as seen through
German eyes, and the political situation in Germany, as dominated by
the Junkers and annexationists, duly supplied it. Germany seemed to
have become convinced that a German peace was certain. Her confidence
was stated to be based on the war map, added to a belief that a lack
of cohesion and community of spirit prevailed among the Allies, in
contrast with her own unified will to victory, and that the United
States was merely gesturing in entering the war. There was obvious
camouflage in affecting to question the solidarity of the Allies and
to asperse the sincerity of American intervention; but no posturing
was perceived in Germany's reliance on the war map as a tangible basis
for a German peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>(p. 106)</span> The kaiser's new chancellor, Count von Hertling, addressing
the Reichstag main committee on January 22, 1918, emphasized this
reliance in a speech which constituted a tardy response to the war
aims reaffirmed by Lloyd-George and President Wilson. Demanding that
the Entente Powers abandon their attitude that Germany was the guilty
party who must do penance and promise improvement, he said:</p>

<p>"They may take it from me that our military position was never so
favorable as it now is. Our highly gifted army leaders face the future
with undiminished confidence in victory. Throughout the army, in the
officers and the men, lives unbroken the joy of battle.</p>

<p>"Our repeatedly expressed willingness for peace and the spirit of
reconciliation revealed by our proposals must not be regarded by the
Entente as a license permitting the indefinite lengthening of the war.</p>

<p>"If the leaders of the enemy powers really are inclined toward peace
let them revise their program once again. If they do that and come
forward with fresh proposals, then we will examine them carefully."</p>

<p>This was by way of preface to answering President Wilson's fourteen
requirements if the United States was to lay down its arms. The first
four, in the chancellor's view, were susceptible to agreement. Germany
accepted in principle the abolition of secret diplomacy and favored
open covenants of peace. The chancellor saw no difference of opinion
on the subject of freedom of navigation upon the seas; but it was
"highly important for the freedom of shipping in future if strongly
fortified naval bases on important international routes, such as
England has at Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, Hongkong, the Falkland Islands,
and many other places, were removed." Further, Germany was in accord
with the President regarding the removal of economic barriers that
interfered with international trade. She also affirmed that the
limitation of armaments desired by President Wilson was "discussable."</p>

<p>The fifth clause of the Wilson peace aims, which called for
self-determination by colonial peoples as to whose sovereignty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>(p. 107)</span> they should recognize, was less easily disposed of. The
chancellor evaded the issue by throwing the onus of putting the
proposal in practice upon Great Britain:</p>

<p>"I believe that for the present it may be left for England, which has
the greatest colonial empire, to make what she will of this proposal
of her ally. This point of the program also will have to be discussed
in due time, on the reconstitution of the world's colonial
possessions."</p>

<p>Thus Germany submitted, as one of the foundations of peace, that
England should not only abandon her naval bases but assent to the
dismemberment of her colonial empire.</p>

<p>The President's demand for the evacuation of Russian territory was met
by a refusal. The Entente Powers having declined to participate in the
negotiations between the so-called Russian Government and the Teutonic
Powers, the matter was one to be decided between the negotiators
alone.</p>

<p>Belgium was not to be evacuated and restored as a condition insisted
upon by the United States. The settlement of the Belgian question, the
chancellor said, belonged to the peace conference:</p>

<p>"So long as our opponents have unreservedly taken the stand-point that
the integrity of the Allies' territory can offer the only possible
basis of peace discussion, I must adhere to the stand-point hitherto
always adopted and refuse the removal in advance of the Belgian affair
from the entire discussion."</p>

<p>The chancellor took the same attitude toward the question of freeing
and restoring the invaded French territory and of the return of
Alsace-Lorraine to France to right an old wrong. "The occupied parts
of France are a valued pawn in our hands," said the chancellor. "The
conditions and methods of procedure of the evacuation, which must take
account of Germany's vital interest, are to be agreed upon between
Germany and France. I can only again expressly accentuate the fact
that there can never be a question of dismemberment of imperial
territory."</p>

<p>The next four Wilson requirements (VIII to XI), relating to a
readjustment of the frontiers of Italy, autonomy for the subjugated
races of Austria-Hungary, the restoration and integrity <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>(p. 108)</span> of
Rumania, Serbia and Montenegro were not Germany's immediate concern,
and the chancellor airily relegated them to Austria-Hungary for
consideration. As to Turkey, for whose subject races the President
demanded self-government, as well as a free Dardanelles, the
chancellor intimated that her integrity vitally concerned the German
Empire, while the future of Poland was to rest entirely in the hands
of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Finally, President Wilson's proposed
league of nations admitted of basic consideration only when all other
pending questions had been settled.</p>

<p>The chancellor's answer was a mere repetition of the defiant and
arrogant presentations of the German position with which the Allies
had become familiar. The war aims of the President to which Count von
Hertling could assent were of trivial importance compared to the
Allies' chief aim&mdash;the overthrow of Prussian militarism. Peace
gropings had produced another declaration of war. Germany openly
announced that she was engaged on a war of conquest. Chancellor von
Hertling's address admitted of no other interpretation. The fate of
Poland was to be decided by the kaisers, that is, annexed in
substance, if not in form. The Baltic provinces of Russia were
earmarked for Germany, and Russia, thus cut off from the western seas,
was to have icebound Archangel and distant Vladivostok as her only
ports. The disposition or division of Rumania, Serbia, and Montenegro
was to be left to Austria-Hungary, with Germany pledged to support
her decisions. Armenia, Palestine, and Arabia, were to be returned to
the Turks, while as to Constantinople and the Dardanelles no
settlement could be permitted that was not agreeable to German
imperialism. As to Belgium, the conclusion was that it would receive
the same status as Luxemburg had before the war, with railroads,
ports, commerce, and army in German hands. Not even the return of
northern France was promised, this being a question to be discussed,
not with the Allies, but only between Germany and France, and
Alsace-Lorraine was to be kept on the fraudulent claim that it was and
always had been German territory. The question of Italia Irredenta was
remitted to Austria-Hungary, and the German colonies were to be
restored, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>(p. 109)</span> regardless of the wishes of their inhabitants or
the safety of their neighbors.</p>

<p>When this grandiose scheme of conquest was ratified and realized,
then, and then only, would Germany consider entering into a league of
peace, or discuss mutual disarmament, or other of the Allies'
proposals for safeguarding peace when it came. Germany sought to be
placed in possession of doubled power before she would even talk about
creating conditions making for a durable peace. She must be able to
reject flatly any scheme proposed, and then, snapping her fingers,
defy the Allies to do what they would, for she in no wise bound
herself to disarm a single soldier or spike a single gun.</p>

<p>The Austrian Reichsrat heard a speech of a different tenor by Count
Czernin, Foreign Minister, on the subject of President Wilson's peace
aims. The contrast in tone from that of Chancellor von Hertling was so
marked and significant as to revive the preexisting belief that the
road to peace negotiations would eventually be opened through Austria.
Though Count Czernin's speech resolutely upheld the integrity of
Austria-Hungary and the preservation and development of her
neighboring interests without dictation from the Entente Powers, he
held out an olive branch that seemed less of an imitation than those
offered by Berlin.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "there is no harm in stating that I regard the
recent proposals of President Wilson as an appreciable approach to the
Austro-Hungarian point of view, and that to some of them
Austria-Hungary joyfully could give her approval.</p>

<p>"Our views are identical not only on the broad principles regarding a
new organization of the world after the war, but also on several
concrete questions, and differences which still exist do not appear to
me to be so great that a conversation regarding them would not lead to
enlightenment and a rapprochement.</p>

<p>"This situation, which doubtless arises from the fact that
Austria-Hungary on the one side and the United States on the other are
composed of States whose interests are least at variance with one
another, tempts one to ask if an exchange of ideas between the two
powers could not be the point of departure for a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>(p. 110)</span> personal
conversation among all States which have not yet joined in peace
negotiations."</p>

<p>This conciliatory overture&mdash;significantly addressed, the Allies
quickly noticed, only to the United States&mdash;was clearly governed by
expediency. Count Czernin revealed a recognition of the critical
condition of internal affairs in Austria-Hungary, and sought to make
advances that would placate the restless and war-worn people of the
dual monarchy without offending the autocratic rulers in Berlin. If
peace could come by compromise, then let there be compromise, and
approaches to the United States seemed to afford a line of least
resistance.</p>

<p>Austria's sincerity, however, was questioned alike in Washington,
Paris, and London. Count Czernin was suspected of dangling a familiar
bait to split the Allies. The Administration view was that his
endeavor to single out the United States as a party with whom to begin
preliminary peace conversations was so naive as to be amusing if the
situation were not so serious. His invitation was not acceptable. The
American Government had thrown in its lot with Great Britain, France,
and Italy, and was determined to stand or fall with them. His attempt
to promote a separate peace between Austria and the United States was
viewed as inspired by a hope that its consideration would either
lessen the effectiveness of America's part in the war or provide an
opportunity for the pacifists in the Allied countries to extend such a
peace movement to the other powers before the war's purposes had been
achieved.</p>

<p>The French view was that while the deliverances of Count von Hertling
and Count Czernin disclosed that a real cleavage on peace sentiment
existed in the two Central Empires, and that the Austrian minister was
the first of their spokesmen to show breadth and detachment, the
contrast between the two speeches indicated Germanesque stage play.
Germany's move was not to show a conciliatory spirit; she left Austria
to perform that rôle. The Allies could take their choice in measuring
the negotiable value of the two outgivings.</p>

<p>The Allies decided that the war must proceed. Germany regarded herself
as a conqueror, was determined upon aggression, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>(p. 111)</span> and would
listen to no peace terms except her own. Count Czernin's conciliatory
tone was discounted by his declared fidelity to Austria's alliance to
Germany. The two speeches were believed to have been concocted in
collusion with the object of springing a combined diplomatic offensive
against the Entente Allies.</p>

<p>"The attack," said the London "Times," "obviously was intended to
shake the solidarity of our defense at several points, but President
Wilson manifestly was the chief objective of the converging forces.
Neither speech discloses the least readiness to make any concessions
which the Allies declare to be indispensable."</p>

<p>The effect of the Austro-German pronouncements on Great Britain was to
stiffen her resolution to continue hostilities. Little weight was
attached to what Austria, the tool of Germany, had to say; the
former's peace yearnings, set against the latter's aspirations, were
impotent unless energized by a revolution in the dual monarchy. The
British only took cognizance of Count von Hertling's words, which
confirmed the prevalent belief that Prussian militarism considered
itself more firmly seated in the saddle than ever, and that although
the chancellor seemed to hold the reins, the team which drew the
German car of state was at the mercy of Ludendorff's whip and
Hindenburg's spur.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="title">MOVING THE MILITARY MACHINE</p>


<p>When Congress closed an epochal session on October 6, 1917, it had
appropriated over twenty-one billion dollars. Except for
$7,000,000,000 loaned to the Allies, and another billion for the
normal expenses of the Government, the amount voted was placed at the
service of the Administration as America's sinews of war for defeating
the Central Powers. No nation had applied such a huge sum to war
purposes in a like period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>(p. 112)</span> The loans to the Allies were not considered as part of the
American war outlays. The Allies gave their own bonds to the
Government as collateral for the loans, bearing the same rate of
interest, and a condition attached to the loans was that the money be
spent in the United States for war equipment. Hence the loans were
allocated for the purchase of material in this country and
substantially aided American industries.</p>

<p>Included in the work of Congress was final agreement on a war revenue
measure after six months of debate (with wide divergence of taxation
plans between the House and Senate) estimated to produce
$2,534,870,000, of which $851,000,000 was to be levied on incomes, and
$1,000,000,000 on excess profits.</p>

<p>On October 1, 1917, the Government appealed for popular subscriptions
to the second Liberty Loan for $3,000,000,000. As in the case of the
first Liberty Loan the response at the outset flagged. Two weeks later
only 14 per cent. of the maximum total had been subscribed and a daily
subscription of $358,000,000 was needed to make the loan a success
within the time allotted for receiving subscriptions. A period of
apprehension and misgiving followed; but that had happened during the
floatation of the first loan, and no European war loan had been asked
without a similar experience. It was not an easy task to draw three
billion dollars from the public purse, and the purse was leisurely,
even lax, in loosening its strings. It needed a nationwide advertising
propaganda to open it. The President entered the fray by naming a
Liberty Day, fixed for October 24, on which he asked the American
people to assemble in their respective communities and pledge to one
another and to the Government the fullest measure of financial
support.</p>

<p>"The might of the United States," he declared in his proclamation, "is
being mobilized and organized to strike a mortal blow at autocracy in
defense of outraged American rights and of the cause of liberty.
Billions of dollars are required to arm, feed, and clothe the brave
men who are going forth to fight our country's battles and to assist
the nations with whom we are making common cause against a common foe.
To subscribe to the Liberty Loan is to perform a service of
patriotism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>(p. 113)</span> "Let the result be so impressive and emphatic that it will
echo throughout the empire of our enemy as an index of what America
intends to do to bring this war to a victorious conclusion."</p>

<p>The Government's efforts to brace popular interest in the loan, aided
by hundreds of thousands of voluntary workers throughout the country
who formed Liberty Loan organizations, bankers, boy scouts, girl
scouts, the newspapers and magazines, and patriotic, commercial, and
fraternal bodies, produced a flood of subscriptions at the last moment
which dissipated all fear of failure. The people needed driving, knew
that their procrastination called for a dinning advertising campaign
to translate intentions into deeds, and finally yielded good-humoredly
to the impetus. They responded in such good measure that on October
27, 1917, when the loan closed, $4,617,532,300 had been subscribed, or
$1,617,532,300 over the amount asked. The oversubscription exceeded
that which the first loan yielded. Approximately 9,400,000 shared in
applying for the loan. Of this number, it was estimated, 9,306,000, or
99 per cent., subscribed in amounts ranging from $50 to $50,000, the
aggregate of such subscriptions being $2,488,469,350.</p>

<p>The loan proved to be popular in a degree of which the world afforded
no equal. Never had there been a loan taken by 9,400,000 subscribers.
It surpassed all previous experience of Government loans. The single
offering was larger than the total takings in all subscriptions made
in the four years of the Civil War. It far exceeded the response to
any government loan of the other belligerents.</p>

<p>With an ample treasury to draw from, provided by Congress and the
public, the Government proceeded with the war preparations, but in
face of inevitable obstacles and friction. The American military
establishment was not designed for making War on a huge scale, and,
like the British War Office at the beginning of hostilities, was
swamped and confused by an avalanche of new responsibilities. There
were admitted shortages in clothing, artillery, and machine guns in
the cantonments, and delays in the construction of new shipping also
produced impatient criticism. Congress interposed by investigations
into <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span> the general conduct of the war, with the result that the
air was cleared and defects of organization located. The
investigations appeared to have developed primarily not so much from
ineffective and wrong decisions in meeting war needs as from delays
due to indecision and procrastination. The result was a change of
administrative methods aiming at a centralization of authority, which
England and France had early found imperative in conducting the war,
instead of depending on a bureaucratic system with its complicated
channels of distributed authority. The friction which had arisen
seemed to be substantially due to a clash between the methods of
business men, whom the administration had requisitioned into war
service, and the red tape of an established governmental system. The
Administration recognized at length that an infusion into the
Government ranks of capable business organizers, bent on conducting
their share of the war with expedition, could not blend with
departmental systems clogged by traditions, customs, rules, and
regulations, written and unwritten. The whole Government became
engaged in a process of introspection. The investigations compelled it
to see itself as others saw it, and were salutary in that respect
alone. In other directions the inquiries revealed, in spite of
departmental shortcomings, that an enormous amount of work had been
accomplished in a short time. When war was declared the country was
wholly unprepared; it was working at full capacity in many war fields
to maintain the largest foreign commerce reached in its history. Its
industries being thus occupied on the outbreak of war, they could not
readily digest a flood of orders, aggregating more than ten billion
dollars in value, which the Government suddenly superimposed upon
their capacities, with their equipments already driving at top speed
under forced draft. On one point at least there was agreement&mdash;that
the task so far accomplished could not have been done in the same
period by any other nation.</p>

<p>In Secretary Baker's view, much of the criticism leveled at the War
Department was due to a natural and praiseworthy impatience of the
people at large to build a war machine worthy of their country's
power. "Every one of us," he said, "wants to see <span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>(p. 115)</span> our country
hit like a man at the adversary." Answering the charge that the War
Department had fallen down the Secretary set out to remove the
impression prevalent in the country that the failures and delays were
disproportionate to what had been achieved. He thereupon disclosed the
results accomplished.</p>

<p>On April 1, 1917, a few days before the United States declared war on
Germany, the army stood at 9,524 officers and 202,510 men. On December
31 of that year this force had grown to 110,856 officers and 1,428,650
men, composed of the regular army, the National Guard, and the
National Army. In other respects the work accomplished by the War
Department at the close of 1917 was summed up by Secretary Baker as
under:</p>

<p>"1. A large army is in the field and in training; so large that
further increments to it can be adequately equipped and trained as
rapidly as those already in training can be transported.</p>

<p>"2. The army has been enlisted and selected without serious
dislocation of the industries of the country.</p>

<p>"3. The training of the army is proceeding rapidly, and its spirit is
high. The subsistence of the army has been above criticism; its
initial clothing supply, temporarily inadequate, is now substantially
complete, and reserves will rapidly accumulate. Arms of the most
modern and effective kind&mdash;including artillery, machine guns,
automatic rifles, and small arms&mdash;have been provided by manufacture or
purchase for every soldier in France, and are available for every
soldier who can be gotten to France in the year 1918.</p>

<p>"4. A substantial army is ready in France, where both men and
officers have been additionally and specially trained and are ready
for active service.</p>

<p>"5. Independent lines of communication and supply and vast storage and
other facilities are in process of construction in France.</p>

<p>"6. Great programs for the manufacture of additional equipment and for
the production of new instruments of war have been formulated."</p>

<p>An outcome of the investigation was the creation of a War Council
within the War Department, composed of the Secretary <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span> of War,
the Assistant Secretary of War, and five general officers. Its purpose
was to supervise and coordinate the supplies of the field armies and
the military relations of those armies with the War Department.</p>

<p>The National Army, composed of civilians enrolled under the selective
draft law, was the most ambitious experiment in constructive military
organization any country had ever attempted. It presented innumerable
problems for which no solutions could be found in available textbooks,
and the celerity with which it was converted into a real army rested
wholly upon the skill with which the problems were grappled by the
cantonment commanders and drill officers. Before the magnitude of a
training organization could be considered and the drilling set in
motion, much groundwork had to be covered in preparing the
cantonments. There were sixteen of them, situated in various sections
of the country, each roughly housing 40,000 men, and cost the
Government at least $100,000,000. Their sites generally were in
rugged, partially cleared country, marked by scrubby timber, dirt
roads, wooden buildings, occasional patches of canvas, clouds of dust
or acres of mud. They sprang up, in brief, out of wilderness tracts,
usually some miles away from large centers of population. Their
construction meant the creation out of the void of sixteen fully
equipped cities, furnished with water supply, sewage systems, electric
installations, governing organizations, police, and transportation.
Standardization of construction was the only method by which the camps
could be brought into being with dispatch. Each type of building, and
every stick and board, ventilator and window sash used therein for all
the cantonments were shaped to identical measurements, and produced by
the enormous driving power of modern engineering, working under
contract. Out of industrial plants, devising standardized material,
came the camps. The number of buildings in the camps varied from 1,200
to 1,600, and included, besides the barracks proper, kitchens, shower
baths and sanitary units, hospitals and administration offices,
churches, schools, clubs and lodges, laundries, commissary stores, and
even moving-picture theaters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> The first stage of training the men was confined largely to
elementary military drill, which was a test of their physical capacity
to withstand the driving routine of marching fifteen to twenty miles a
day, burdened with a sixty-pound pack, ammunition, and rifle. The
second stage embraced advanced military drill, involving several weeks
of Swedish exercises, manipulating the army Springfield and marching
and countermarching in close or extended order. The third phase was
specialized warfare as taught abroad, with British and French trench
instructors.</p>

<p>Military tactics having been revolutionized by modern trench warfare,
no time was wasted in the open-country maneuvers formerly employed to
accustom the troops to actual field service. The National Army was
trained for the single purpose of effective trench fighting. On
adjacent hillsides and plains extensive field fortifications were
prepared, equipped with barbed-wire entanglements, artillery, and
machine-gun emplacements, bomb-proof dugouts, communication trenches,
support trenches, listening posts, and every other device which had
been evolved from the war operations in Europe. The men were taught
how to enter and leave a trench, to repel attacks, make raids in
pursuit of information, surprise forays by day or night behind the
protection of barrage fire, and how to take care of themselves, repair
artillery damage, and reenforce the barbed-wire barriers.</p>

<p>The training was intensive and embraced a sixteen weeks' course
crowded with manifold detail, which was vigorously observed. More
attention was paid in the curriculum to drilling individual men,
platoons, and companies than to conducting brigade, divisional, and
regimental exercises, these latter being deferred until the smaller
units were fit for advanced warfare. The platoon, commanded by a
lieutenant, was the fighting unit in trench operations, and upon the
lieutenants was therefore imposed the responsibility of training less
than company units in order to effect an intimate and sympathetic
cooperation between officers and men when they encountered the stern
realities of warfare in Europe.</p>

<p>Camp conditions formed a chief subject of the Congressional
investigation. The War Department had been confronted with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span>
the task of providing for a new army which had to be rushed into
training, and had to depend upon congested railroad facilities to
equip the camps. But everything had been done, Secretary Baker told
the committee, to care for the men, and where defects had occurred
they were quickly removed.</p>

<p>"And where, I want to know, in all history can you find an achievement
comparable to that of America's in raising this great army from her
citizenry in this period of time?" asked the Secretary of War. "It has
never been done before, and it is to America's credit that she has
accomplished it in the nine months we have been at war."</p>

<p>The outlook, as viewed by Secretary Baker, was that if adequate
transport facilities were available, 1,500,000 men could be shipped to
France during 1918. He indicated that a third of that number would be
on the western front early in the year as a forerunner of the main
body.</p>

<p>The country appeared satisfied by this prospect. The War Secretary had
revealed much information regarding the military preparations to the
Senate investigators; but he had to suppress much more to keep
Germany&mdash;who was anxious to learn General Pershing's plans&mdash;in the
dark, especially as to the number and disposition of American troops
already there. The conclusions drawn from the progress of war
preparations at the beginning of 1918 were that greater advances had
been made than was expected. American troops would be in the thick of
the fighting in the early spring and would be greatly reenforced just
as soon as the Entente Allies pooled their tonnage resources.</p>

<p>The Administration's critics in Congress, nevertheless, were not
pacified. A bill was proposed in the Senate creating a War Cabinet,
the purpose of which was to divest the executives of Government
departments of all authority in the conduct of the war. The new body
was to be composed of "three distinguished citizens of demonstrated
ability," to be named by the President and indorsed by the Senate.
They were to control the administrative Cabinet officers and other
department heads in the war's conduct, and adjust all differences,
subject to the President's review.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>(p. 119)</span> The President saw in the proposed new war administration
nothing but "long additional delays" and the turning of the
Government's experience into "mere lost motion." He said as much to
Senator Chamberlain, the author of the measure, in a letter which
stoutly defended the Government's military preparations.</p>

<p>"The War Department," he wrote, "has performed a task of unparalleled
magnitude and difficulty with extraordinary promptness and efficiency.
There have been delays and disappointments and partial miscarriages of
plan, all of which have been drawn into the foreground and exaggerated
by the investigations which have been in progress since the Congress
assembled.... But by comparison with what has been accomplished, these
things, much as they were to be regretted, were insignificant, and no
mistake has been made which has been repeated."</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="title">FLEETS IN THE MAKING</p>


<p>The navy was not exempt from the searchlight Congress cast upon the
manifold war preparations of the Government. But nothing was adduced
before the investigating subcommittee to indicate that the Navy
Department had not met the abnormal situation produced by American
belligerency. The outstanding development disclosed was that the navy
had more than 1,000 ships commissioned in the winter of 1917, as
against 300 two years ago; that 425 vessels were under construction,
exclusive of 350 submarine chasers; and that contracts had been let
for building hundreds of other small craft.</p>

<p>The expansion of the navy occasioned by the war was notable in other
directions. Since January 1, 1917, the naval force increased from
4,500 officers and 68,000 men to 15,000 officers and 254,000 men; the
number of stations operated by the navy from 130 to 363; the number of
civil employees from 35,000 to 60,000; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>(p. 120)</span> the strength of the
Naval Reserve from a few hundreds to 49,246 men; the average monthly
expenditures from $8,000,000 to $60,000,000; the Hospital Corps from
1,600 to 7,000; the National Naval Volunteers from zero to 16,000 men;
the Marine Corps from 344 officers and 9,921 men to 1,197 officers and
30,000 men.</p>

<p>The navy placed great reliance on destroyers to fulfill the part
allotted to it in the sea warfare against German submarines. A
formidable fleet of these vessels was planned at a cost of
$350,000,000, and contracts for the construction were placed with five
shipbuilding concerns in October, 1917. Their actual number was
guarded as a military secret. It was the largest project the navy
department had undertaken, and would probably give the United States a
destroyer fleet exceeding those of all other countries. The
expenditure embraced the expansion of existing shipbuilding plants and
the building of additional engine and boiler factories, as the
destroyer program taxed the full capacity of the shipbuilding
industry.</p>

<p>The destroyer had proved to be the deadliest weapon utilized against
the submarine, and was superior to the submarine chaser, even for
harbor and in-shore patrol work, besides having better seagoing
qualities. Submarine chasers were regarded as a necessity, but the
navy evinced little enthusiasm for them as a weapon of permanent
effectiveness, and rather pinned its faith to an overwhelming
destroyer armada to combat the U-boats.</p>

<p>In aviation the Government made no less impressive strides. The
building of 20,000 aeroplanes, for which Congress had voted
$640,000,000, was undertaken for the creation of a great American
aerial force to operate against Germany. Their types covered the whole
range of training machines, light, high-speed fighting airships, and
powerful battle and bombing planes of heavy design. The training of
aviators, the building of motors, and the assembling and framing of
the wings proceeded uniformly so that men and equipment would be ready
for service simultaneously.</p>

<p>Numbers of American aviators were already abroad undergoing intensive
training behind the battle fronts. The thousands <span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>(p. 121)</span> in training
at home were coached by a corps of Allied air experts of various
nationalities, forming virtually an international aviation general
staff for organizing the American aerial force.</p>

<p>The United States had set out resolutely to do its part in wresting
the air spaces over the western front from Germany. The arrival in
France in the autumn of 1917 of a group of American aviators with
American-built airships brought an administration announcement which
viewed the event as of signal importance. The opportunity rested with
the United States to give its Allies such a great preponderance of
airships that the enemy would be driven from the skies altogether,
impotent either to give battle or defend himself. With this aim in
view, Congress was asked for further funds for developing aviation
during 1918 and 1919 to the amount of $1,138,000,000, of which it was
proposed that $1,032,294,260 be expended on aviation: $553,219,120 on
extra engines and spare parts, $235,866,000 for airplanes and
hydroaeroplanes, $77,475,000 for machine guns, $8,050,000 for schools
for military aeronautics, and the balance for stations, depots,
equipment, upkeep, and pay for instructors, inspectors, mechanics,
engineers, accountants, &amp;c.</p>

<p>There was an army of aviators to meet all this development in
equipment, numbering, at the beginning of 1918, 3,900 officers and
82,120 men.</p>

<p>Perhaps the shipping situation called most for legislative
investigation. The paramount need of the Allies was for 6,000,000 tons
annually, and the British Shipping Controller warned that if the
United States could not produce this tonnage to replace the losses by
submarines the Allies' military and naval efforts would be crippled.
The construction of new tonnage in American shipyards had been beset
by personal conflicts in the shipping administration, resulting in
reversals of policy and retarded operations. Edward J. Hurley,
chairman of the Shipping Board, told the Senate investigating
committee that one obstacle to the expeditious pursuit of the vast
program of ship construction was that it had been superimposed on an
equally extensive naval program. When war was declared 70 per cent. of
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span> eighteen prominent shipyards then in existence were
overtaxed by the naval program, while only the remaining 30 per cent.
of the yards could be utilized to proceed with the mercantile ship
program. The task was to bring an adequate merchant marine into being
to assist the Allies and he assured the committee (December, 1917)
that it was being accomplished with the utmost dispatch despite past
dissensions and many obstacles. The number of ships under construction
or contract was 1,427, representing 8,573,108 dead-weight tons. Of
this number 431 were ships embracing 3,056,000 tons which were in
course of building in the yards for private and foreign owners and had
been commandeered for war service under Government order. The rest
were composed of 559 steel ships of 3,965,200 dead-weight tons, 379
wooden ships of 1,344,900 dead-weight tons, and 58 composite ships of
207,000 tons. The main need in proceeding with this huge program was
shipyard space. New yards constructed and tonnage contracts awarded to
each called for a constant expansion in the shipping organization, so
that by the end of 1917 the Shipping Board controlled 132 yards, of
which only 58 were old establishments, the remainder, 74, being new.</p>

<p>The burden imposed on American shipyards can be realized by
contrasting their output in the prewar period with the total tonnage
under construction for both the navy and the Shipping Board. The navy
program was the equivalent in value, and therefore in shipbuilding
effort, of 2,500,000 tons of merchant shipping. The mercantile marine
program represented a tonnage of over 8,500,000. Here was 11,000,000
tons being produced by American shipyards whose greatest previous
output in one year had only amounted to 615,000 tons according to Mr.
Hurley. For 1918 he promised an output of 6,000,000 tons. Of the
vessels under contract a good proportion were of 7,500 tons or more,
classified as cargo steamers, and of these a number were designed
specially for transports.</p>

<p>Tonnage being the immediate need, the Shipping Board did not wait for
the completion of the new construction to supply it. As a war
emergency measure it requisitioned all American ocean cargo and
passenger-carrying vessels over 2,500 tons. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>(p. 123)</span> This step was
taken as a means to control freight rates as well as to enable the
Government to command the tonnage it needed for war purposes. American
merchant vessels for oversea traffic exceeded 2,000,000 tonnage. Some
had already been requisitioned by the army and navy. With the
exception of craft taken over for Government service, the vessels were
left in their owners' hands for operation on Government account as the
Shipping Board directed.</p>

<p>Between 600,000 and 700,000 tons of German shipping seized in American
ports had already been utilized as troop transports and freighters for
reenforcing the American army in France. These vessels included the
<i>Leviathan</i>, formerly the <i>Vaterland</i>, which was capable of carrying
10,000 troops on a single voyage, but the number was limited to 8,000
to insure comfort. In January, 1918, it was disclosed that the
<i>Leviathan</i>, with fifteen other former German ships, had safely
reached Entente ports laden with men and supplies. The announcement
was made from the American army headquarters in France to disprove
false reports circulated in Germany belittling the assistance rendered
the Entente cause by the use of these vessels. They had, on their
first voyage, escaped the submarines, a feat which was not palatable
to Germany, who sought to bolster up a waning popular confidence in
the U-boat campaign. The German vessels which had run the gantlet,
besides the <i>Vaterland</i>, were the <i>Covington</i> (ex-<i>Cincinnati</i>),
<i>America</i> (ex-<i>Amerika</i>), <i>President Grant</i>, <i>President Lincoln</i>,
<i>Powhatan</i> (ex-<i>Hamburg</i>), <i>Madawaska</i> (ex-<i>König Wilhelm II</i>),
<i>George Washington</i>, <i>Mount Vernon</i> (ex-<i>Kronprinzessin Cecilie</i>),
<i>Agamemnon</i> (ex-<i>Kaiser Wilhelm II</i>), <i>Aeolus</i> (ex-<i>Grosser
Kurfürst</i>), <i>Mercury</i> (ex-<i>Barbarossa</i>), <i>Pocahontas</i> (ex-<i>Princess
Irene</i>), <i>Huron</i> (ex-<i>Friedrich der Grosse</i>), <i>Von Steuben</i>
(ex-<i>Kronprinz Wilhelm</i>), <i>De Kalb</i> (ex-<i>Prinz Eitel Friedrich</i>).</p>

<p>A further step to expedite the shipment of men and supplies to Europe
was the formation of a Committee of Shipping Control, composed of
American and Allied membership. Its chief object was to endeavor to
fulfill Secretary Baker's expectation that 1,500,000 American troops
and their requisite equipment <span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>(p. 124)</span> could be landed in France in
1918 if sufficient shipping was available. It was endowed with power
of absolute control in the allocation of all tonnage on both sides of
the Atlantic, and aimed to end the complications and delays that had
hitherto prevented the fullest use of American shipping for war
purposes.</p>

<p>The Shipping Board had succeeded in turning over to the War Department
over 1,000,000 tons of ships on the bare board basis for the
transportation of soldiers, live stock, and munitions. Much of this
tonnage was commandeered by the Government for that purpose, the
shipyards not being sufficiently advanced in their work to provide
much new construction. To facilitate the production of the enormous
amount of new tonnage under way the Board sought a further
appropriation of $800,000,000, increasing the amount Congress had
authorized for the shipping program to $2,100,000,000.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="title">FOOD AS A WAR FACTOR</p>

<p>Economic conditions generally had been shaped and dictated by the
nation's entry into the war. The financial advantages which the
country enjoyed in the two previous years through being neutral and
not belligerent, disappeared with the war declaration; but the
accumulated resources of the country's previous neutrality remained a
continuing bulwark, and its distance from the theaters of war gave the
country certain economic advantages of a neutral.</p>

<p>The situation greatly changed upon the United States throwing its
entire resources into the common stock of the Entente Allies. The
Government's enormous advances of credits to them took place when its
own war requirements were even larger. Shipments to the Allies of
maximum consignments of food and equipment proceeded in face of heavy
home demands for the same products. The abnormal efforts with which
the Shipping <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>(p. 125)</span> Board set about building new ships to repair the
ravages of the submarines coincided with unexampled calls upon the
mills for domestic needs. Such developments could not occur without
profoundly affecting American finance and production; especially in
view of the intensified economic strain on belligerent Europe by the
continuance of the war through another year and the reliance of the
Allies on American aid.</p>

<p>There came an immediate and violent rise in commodity prices, due
largely to the Government's new demands, coming in the wake of the
increased needs of the Allies. As a consequence maximum prices on many
products were imposed either by imperative Government orders or by
agreement between the Government and the producers. The wheat crop
failed in volume, being barely eleven million bushels above the
deficient yield of 1916, and except for that season was the smallest
in half a dozen years. On the other hand, corn and oats yielded
record-breaking crops, and there was such an excellent harvest of
other cereals that the total out-turn of the five leading grains,
including wheat, exceeded by 970,000,000 bushels that of 1916. Except
for 1915 the general crops surpassed in yield that of any other year.
The war, however, robbed the country of the fruit of its own
fertility. The effect of full granaries was offset by a European wheat
harvest worse even than that of 1916 and by the difficulty of sparing
ships to bring Australia's wheat to Europe. The demand on American
wheat for export became so urgent that the Government was compelled
to place the wheat trade virtually in the hands of a paramount
commission.</p>

<p>Governmental food control became a reality on November 1, 1917, when
the manufacture, storage, importation, and distribution of practically
all essential foodstuffs came under the jurisdiction of the Food
Administration headed by Herbert C. Hoover, and could only be
conducted under license from that body. Probably the Government had
never before undertaken such a step in commercial regulation which
came so close to the lives of the people. About twenty important and
inclusive classes of food were brought under Federal control.
Virtually the whole machinery of their manufacture and distribution
became <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>(p. 126)</span> subject to Federal pressure. All food brokers,
commission men, wholesalers, jobbers, warehousemen, importers, and
grain elevator men not previously licensed were required to take out
permits, in most cases without reference to the size of their
business. Only meat packers, canners, millers, egg packers, ginners,
etc., whose business was small, were exempted. All retailers whose
gross sales of food exceeded $100,000 yearly were licensed. The
control affected small retailers also, for it was expressly provided
by Mr. Hoover that no licensee shall "knowingly sell any food
commodity to any person who shall, after this regulation goes into
effect, violate the provisions" of the Food Administration Act; and
wholesalers and jobbers were to be furnished information concerning
small retailers who hoarded or extorted. It also affected
manufacturers and dealers whose merchandise was not included in the
specified classes of food controlled.</p>

<p>The object, of course, was to keep food prices down to the minimum.
The Food Administration Act forbade manipulation or speculation,
excessive profits, discriminatory practices, and waste. The licensing
system was simply a means of enforcing these prohibitions. Mr. Hoover
looked for their successful operation not so much by formulating
strict regulations as by awakening a spirit of public service among
food traders.</p>

<p>The grocers undertook to concentrate their efforts upon selling
substitutes for white flour and meat, in view of the Allies' calls on
American produce and the consequent shortage for home purposes.
Retailers promised to encourage the sale of "articles of food cheap
but good in quality in place of high-priced staples." Wholesale
grocers were urged to arrange with manufacturers for larger supplies
of corn meal, rye, and oat products. Food distributing and selling
organizations throughout the country began a campaign to induce
retailers to stop soliciting orders, to reduce deliveries to one daily
for a family or route, and to stimulate the sale of prunes, oats, corn
meal, and rice in bulk and for cash. Mr. Hoover had laid down the
principle that it was the delivered cost of food to jobber,
wholesaler, and merchant that determined the price on resale, and not
market conditions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>(p. 127)</span> at the time of resale. No one was to profit
by fluctuations upward while he held goods in stock.</p>

<p>The Food Administration's task was to awaken millions of families to
recognize the necessity of food conservation, to educate millions of
producers to maximum effort, and to banish greed from the business of
thousands of distributors. The last presented the greatest difficulty.
Yet the readiness of dealers to be content with living-profit margins
and to increase efficiency, the eagerness of commission men to
discourage all speculation and to help constructively in effecting
adequate deliveries on full cars, and the assurances of most
distributors that they would aid in bringing recalcitrants into
subjection, promised that the problem was not impossible of solution.
Profiteering had been one of the banes of the war in Europe, and the
Government sought to check this rapacious method of using war
conditions to acquire ill-gotten gains by traders who preyed upon
public necessities.</p>

<p>Mr. Hoover thus presented the situation in the autumn of 1917:</p>

<p>"There is plenty of food in this country, and our problem is one of
surplus and not a deficit. This does not mean that we can send to the
Allies all they need, for there is not enough when considered from the
war point of view. The wheat we export will be the direct amount that
the people save out of their bread, for we have shipped our surplus
and must keep the bread supply for the country. We will ship wheat or
flour from month to month, but such shipments will not be allowed
except our supply warrants them. Through conservation we are gaining a
20 per cent. surplus of wheat. This means literally that every one who
saves a slice of bread is giving a slice of bread to our Allies. We
are consuming 20 per cent. less wheat than last year."</p>

<p>According to Mr. Hoover, the Allies' wheat requirements from the
United States amounted to 210,000,000 bushels. The country's
production of wheat in 1916 was 670,000,000 bushels, of which
590,000,000 bushels was consumed at home, leaving only 80,000,000
bushels available for export. There were thus 130,000,000 bushels to
be found to fulfill the Allies' needs, that is, by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>(p. 128)</span> saving
that much from the normal consumption of flour by the people. The Food
Administration found a spokesman in President Wilson, who, in a
proclamation, called on the people at large to observe more wheatless
days, and on wheat traders to curtail their stocks and sales.</p>

<p>The application of the slogan, "Food will win the war," was extended
to neutral countries contiguous to Germany. If food was to win the
war, then victory would come by the weakening of Germany through being
unable to obtain American food, since the United States had virtually
become Europe's chief food source, and Germany could always obtain
American supplies through the neutrals. The President stopped further
trading in American food between the neutrals and Germany by a
proclamation ordaining that after August 30, 1917, no exports from
American ports could be shipped, except under a strict license of the
Exports Council, to any country in the Eastern Hemisphere. The
restraint, though made of universal application, was specifically
aimed at the European neutrals which flourished upon trading with
Germany.</p>

<p>A large number of Dutch and other neutral vessels lying in New York
harbor were chartered by the American Government and added to the
available merchant shipping.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="title">TRANSPORTATION AND FUEL</p>


<p>The war was gradually being brought home to the nation, not by tidings
of American troops taking their places side by side with their Allies
in Europe, but by internal changes. The Government stretched forth an
expropriating arm in all directions where public and private service
could be utilized for war purposes, and it duly took charge of the
railroads.</p>

<p>As a war measure, the President's intervention in assuming control of
the country's transportation systems was the most <span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>(p. 129)</span> sweeping
step he had taken under the extraordinary powers vested in him by
Congress. The railroad authorities themselves realized its need. The
war had received many designations, but analyzing its conduct down to
fundamentals, it was a railroad war. So Marshal Joffre had termed it
in recalling how the railroad had enabled him to win the Battle of the
Marne by rushing troops and munitions where they were critically
needed.</p>

<p>The American railroads were already overtaxed when war was declared,
and lacked facilities for proper repairs and new equipment. Early in
1915 and thenceforth they became swamped by a flood of traffic in
munitions, food, and other supplies from the interior to the seaboard
for transshipment overseas to the Allies. They needed more locomotives
and cars for this huge traffic; but the day of reasonable prices had
passed, labor was costly and uncertain, and engine and car builders
were absorbed in producing for the Allies. When the war drew in the
United States the railroad's burdens were swollen manifold by the
transportation problem incident to the mobilizing of an army of
1,500,000 men. Troop trains had to be operated by the tens and
hundreds and even thousands; for every troop train there were ten,
fifteen, and twenty trains of camp equipment; ore and fuel had to be
carried; more and more material called for transit to the seaboard for
the Allies. The traffic grew 50 per cent. above that of 1914, the year
the European war started, and it was operated with little more than 3
per cent. of additional equipment. The working forces of the
railroads, in addition, were depleted, not only by numerous volunteer
enlistments to the regular army, but by the selective draft, and by
the creation of nine full regiments of railroad engineers for service
in France.</p>

<p>Reviewing the situation in December, 1917, the Interstate Commerce
Commission recommended immediate unification of the railroads into one
system, operated under government control, as the only solution of the
problem of conducting the war traffic.</p>

<p>The President by proclamation took over the railroads on December 28,
1917. He exercised this power both under the resolutions declaring war
against Germany and Austria-Hungary, wherein he was authorized to
employ the resources of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>(p. 130)</span> Government and of the country to
bring the conflict to a successful termination, and under an army
appropriation bill passed on August 29, 1916 (eight months before the
United States entered the war), which provided:</p>

<p>"The President, in time of war, is empowered, through the Secretary of
War, to take possession and assume control of any system or systems of
transportation, or any part thereof, and to utilize the same, to the
exclusion as far as may be necessary of all other traffic thereon, for
the transfer or transportation of troops, war material and equipment,
or for such other purposes connected with the emergency as may be
needful or desirable."</p>

<p>The President, explaining his action in a supplementary statement,
told the country:</p>

<p>"This is a war of resources no less than of men, perhaps even more
than of men, and it is necessary for the complete mobilization of our
resources that the transportation systems of the country should be
organized and employed under a single authority and a simplified
method of coordination which have not proved possible under private
management and control.</p>

<p>"The Government of the United States is the only great government now
engaged in the war which has not already assumed control of this sort.
It was thought to be in the spirit of American institutions to attempt
to do everything that was necessary through private management, and if
zeal and ability and patriotic motive could have accomplished the
necessary unification of administration, it would certainly have been
accomplished; but no zeal or ability could overcome insuperable
obstacles, and I have deemed it my duty to recognize that fact in all
candor now that it is demonstrated and to use without reserve the
great authority reposed in me. A great national necessity dictated the
action, and I was therefore not at liberty to abstain from it."</p>

<p>The Government undertook to guarantee to each company such net
earnings as would amount to the ascertained average of the three-year
period ending with June, 1917. The rights of stockholders and
bondholders and other creditors of the railroads were not to be
impaired by the change in control, and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>(p. 131)</span> roads were to be
kept in as good repair and equipment as when taken over. For their
upkeep and betterment the President sought an appropriation of
$500,000,000 from Congress.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Treasury, William G. McAdoo, was appointed
director general. His first act was to order that all terminals,
ports, locomotives, rolling stock and other transportation facilities
be utilized in the common cause of serving the country. By this course
he ended all railroad compacts apportioning the distribution of
traffic, and pooled the terminals for the common use of all carriers
whose lines or cars could reach them.</p>

<p>Meantime a coal famine, due to freight congestion of unexampled
proportions, had been gradually developing. At the beginning of
December the country, except in the northwest, faced a serious
shortage of fuel, not through lack of coal, but through lack of means
to transport it. Dr. H. A. Garfield, the Federal Fuel Administrator,
took steps to have coal and coke given the right of way over general
freight, which in turn was subordinate to the transit of actual war
supplies. Traffic priority of coal shipments was the remedy sought to
loosen the congestion of coal cars at mines and terminals. But
sufficient coal did not reach the various points of distribution for
normal winter use, nor, what was as serious, for war purposes. It was
solely a transportation problem, involving a general freight problem,
and its solution would also solve the fuel problem. The navy and
factories alone required 100,000,000 tons more than they needed
before, and could get little above half that quantity. There came an
imperative call for fuel economy from Dr. Garfield, who warned the
country that unless it could save 50,000,000 tons by retrenchment, the
Government would have to stop the operation of nonessential industries
where coal was a big factor in order to apply the use of fuel so saved
for essential war industries.</p>

<p>In the end Dr. Garfield resorted to heroic measures. Without prior
notice he issued a closing order to the industries east of the
Mississippi, which were thus made to feel the full force of the coal
famine. The operation of all factories, except those <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>(p. 132)</span> engaged
in the manufacture of foodstuffs, was suspended for five days (from
January 18 to January 22, 1918), and they were also to close every
Monday from January 28 to March 25 inclusive. Coal merchants were
required in selling fuel to give preference to railroads, domestic,
and public service consumers, ships for bunker purposes, Government
departments, national and local, and manufacturers of perishable food.
On the five days named and on the succeeding Mondays, no fuel was to
be delivered to any other person or corporation for any purpose except
for plants which must be operated seven days a week to avoid injury to
their equipment, and printing establishments. The curtailment of the
use of fuel was further prescribed on the Mondays named to an extent
that virtually made them holidays. All private, business, and
professional offices, except those of banks and trust companies,
physicians and dentists, were forbidden to be heated or lighted at all
except to avert the danger of damage from frozen apparatus. Wholesale
and retail stores (except those selling food), business buildings,
saloons, theaters, dance halls and all other places of amusement came
under this ban.</p>

<p>The country was startled by the sweeping order. Protests poured into
the White House; Congress was in a ferment; the Senate passed a
resolution urging a postponement of such a drastic step. But Dr.
Garfield remained firm. He insisted that the inadequacy of the coal
supply and transportation facilities to meet the enormous war demands,
coupled with unprecedented adverse weather, had made immediate
restrictive measures imperative. The order, with a few modifications,
was enforced in the face of a rising storm of indignation from a
multitude of objectors who saw nothing but industrial chaos in its
operation.</p>

<p>The protests subsided as quickly as they arose. Industry had received
a violent shock; confusion and uncertainty followed; but the order was
obeyed. It fell with stunning effect upon an unprepared public opinion
which in some directions exploded with symptoms of a panic-stricken
hysteria. But presently it began to dawn on the public mind that if a
cessation of business for a few days helped the railroads to move coal
and war freight, whereby ships could get fuel and cargoes to depart to
Europe, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>(p. 133)</span> and also removed the tantalizing spectacle (one of
many like situations elsewhere) of a coalless New York while 350,000
tons were traffic-bound a few miles away, the fuel-curtailment order
would be remembered as marking a decision of great courage and
statesmanship. The congestion of the railroads and their terminals had
produced a condition bordering on transportation immobility. The
arteries of commerce, as it were, had become frozen. Factories and
plants piled their daily output in railroad yards and near the docks
in rising quantities. The accumulations of undelivered freight grew
and grew and the panting railroads, working beyond the limits of what
their traffic would bear, could only reduce the incubus piecemeal. The
tardy recognition came that, even had there been no coal shortage,
which was the primary cause of the shutdown, a temporary cessation of
manufacture was necessary to clear the loaded tracks and empty the
groaning storehouses before they were burdened with further
accretions from the hives of industry.</p>

<p>The antagonism provoked by the closing order soon gave way to a
cordial spirit of cooperation, and many industries affected undertook
to assume in large part the financial burdens incident to enforced
idleness. Manufacturing was halted and further merchandise was kept
from cluttering the crowded railroads. Improved transportation
conditions followed, due largely to milder weather. The way was
rapidly cleared for a steady movement of coal to tidewater for
bunkering ships loaded with supplies for the American oversea forces
and for the Allies, as well as for supplying domestic fuel needs.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="title">THE LAST DAYS OF KERENSKY</p>


<p>Viewed in the light of later events, there can now remain no doubt of
that the overthrow of the Russian czar was as much a reaction against
war as it was a revolution against autocracy. In July, 1917, Premier
Kerensky, representing the radical intellectuals, rather than the
people as a mass, had attempted to stimulate the enthusiasm of the
armies for another general offensive against the Austro-German forces.
The effort had failed disastrously, not through any tactical mistakes
or through any great lack of equipment or material support, but
because the stiffness had gone out of the backbone of the Russian
soldier. The propaganda of the Bolsheviki had created this situation,
it was said, but propaganda can only crystallize a sentiment: it can
never create it. The rank and file of the Russian armies accepted the
Bolshevist agitators and their doctrines only because their state of
mind was in sympathy. Ivan was willing to face any alternative to
further fighting.</p>

<p>This fact Kerensky evidently realized better than anyone after the
collapse of the midsummer offensive. Either one of two things an army
must possess to fight effectively: iron discipline or enthusiasm. The
latter Kerensky had tried to awaken. He had failed. Hastily he tried
to establish the other: a rule of "blood and iron," as he termed it.
But Kerensky was not of the stuff of which dictators are made. Like
Madero of Mexico, he possessed too abundantly the quality of mercy to
play the rôle of the Prussian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>(p. 135)</span> Kerensky, undoubtedly, knew of the growing antiwar sentiment
in the rank and file of the army. This sentiment prevailed to a much
less extent behind the lines, especially among the intellectuals of
all shades of opinion, and among the commercial classes. Or, perhaps,
it would be more correct to say that these elements saw the necessity
of continuing the war more clearly than did the soldiers at the front
and therefore feared the results of a premature, or separate, peace.</p>

<p>To give the prowar elements an opportunity to express themselves, to
transmit their enthusiasm to the army, perhaps, Kerensky and his
associates of the Provisional Government had called a national
conference, to be held in Moscow in the latter part of August, 1917.
All kinds of organizations and social bodies were invited to send
delegates; the zemstvos, the cooperative societies, the Red Cross, the
labor unions, the professional leagues and the army itself, through
the councils and several of the commanding officers. It was, in fact,
a sort of a provisional general assembly whose authority, Kerensky
hoped, would be strong enough to impress the army.</p>

<p>The scene in the ancient capital on the gathering of this notable
conference, on August 26, 1917, was a picturesque one, especially in
the neighborhood of the Grand Opera House, where the sessions were
being held. As demonstrations on the part of the Bolsheviki had been
threatened, the building itself was surrounded by a chain of soldiers
and picked officers were stationed at every few yards, the majority
of the guards being cadets from the military academies, notable for
their loyalty to the Provisional Government, as distinguished from the
Soviets, or soldiers' councils.</p>

<p>The interior of the Opera House was elaborately decorated, the
footbridge connecting the auditorium with the stage being hung with
festoons of revolutionary red. Among the delegates present, numbering
several hundreds, could be distinguished the various national types
and costumes of Russia; Tartars in peaked caps, white-robed mullahs
from the Volga, Georgians with their gorgeous cassocks and bearded
priests with long hair and beards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>(p. 136)</span> The most notable event of the three days' sessions of the
conference, which, on the whole, accomplished nothing but an excited
debate, was the appearance and speech of General Kornilov, the Cossack
chief. As he mounted the platform, the great majority of the delegates
in the auditorium rose <i>en masse</i> and cheered loudly. The delegates
from the soldiers' councils remained stolidly seated, however, in the
boxes where they were grouped together. Officers shouted at them
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Rise to your feet and show respect!" they cried.</p>

<p>But the soldiers' delegates paid no heed, or some few shouted back:</p>

<p>"We are done with that! We are a free people now!"</p>

<p>General Kornilov made an impassioned plea for the reestablishment of
the death penalty, as the basis for that discipline without which the
army could no longer stem the Teutonic invasion.</p>

<p>"The old régime bequeathed to Russia," he said, "an army which,
despite the defects in its organization, nevertheless was animated by
a fighting spirit and was ready for sacrifices. The measures taken by
those who are completely foreign to the spirit and the needs of the
army have transformed it into a collection of individual groups which
have lost all sense of duty and only tremble for their personal
safety. If Russia wishes to be saved, the army must be regenerated at
any cost."</p>

<p>Here again the general was cheered by all but the representatives of
the army itself, who remained stolidly silent.</p>

<p>None of the elements hid its disappointment over the results of the
conference. And the general disappointment was more or less centered
on Kerensky. His position was, indeed, a difficult one. He realized
the need of a united nation, if the war was to be continued. A radical
himself, affiliated with the Socialist Revolutionary Party, at one
time the most radical of all factions, he now felt drawn toward the
comparatively conservative elements, represented by the Cadets, or
Liberals, on account of their prowar attitude. Yet his human
sympathies were all with the recalcitrant mujiks who, soldiers now at
the front, no longer felt any desire for fighting. Endeavoring to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>(p. 137)</span> draw these two greater elements together, he stood between
and lost the support of each.</p>

<p>The last day of the Moscow Conference marked the beginning of
Kerensky's downfall.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the month and during the beginning of
September, 1917, there was ample evidence that Kerensky was keenly
alive to the dangers about him; counter-revolutions from two
directions. On the one hand were the conservatives, now thoroughly
disgusted with the new régime and the disorganization which it seemed
to them to represent. During the first week of September, 1917, it was
reported that a plot to reestablish, if not the autocracy, at least a
modified form of it, had been uncovered, and a number of titled
personages were arrested, among them Grand Duke Michael
Alexandrovitch, brother of the former czar, and Grand Duke Paul.
General Gurko, too, was accused of writing compromising letters and
was exiled from the country.</p>

<p>But more portentous, considering later events, was the reported
results of a municipal election held in Petrograd, wherein the
Bolsheviki polled an unusually large vote; 174,000, as compared to
182,000 by the more moderate Socialists and 101,000 by the
Constitutional Democrats. It was from this quarter that the second
counter-revolution threatened.</p>

<p>The conservative elements were to be heard from first. Whether they
really attempted a genuine counter-revolution remains to this day
somewhat of a mystery. The facts, as reported, bear very much the
aspect of an intrigue against the conservatives themselves.</p>

<p>On September 10, 1917, it was announced that General Kornilov,
commander in chief, had asked the Provisional Government to eliminate
itself and hand over its power to him; that he proclaimed himself
dictator. Kerensky himself supplied the first details in a personal
proclamation.</p>

<p>Already the next day it was reported that Kornilov was moving troops
on the capital and that he had even begun bombarding government
positions with heavy guns. All the councils were issuing appeals to
their constituents, the soldiers, to refuse <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>(p. 138)</span> support to
Kornilov and to rally to the support of the Government, while this
danger lasted, at least. And then, on the second day, Kerensky
proclaimed himself commander in chief of the Russian military forces,
with General Alexiev, chief of the General Staff, as his second in
command.</p>

<p>Kornilov now issued a proclamation, or statement, from his
headquarters at Mogilev, in which he declared that Kerensky's account
of his interview with the emissary, Lvov, was a fabrication in that
he, Kornilov, had not sent Lvov to Kerensky, but that Kerensky had
sent Lvov to him, Kornilov, with the deliberate purpose of creating a
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>"I, General Kornilov, the son of a peasant," added he, in a later
proclamation, "declare to all that I require nothing personally;
nothing, save the salvation of mighty Russia. I swear to lead the
nation by the road of victory over the foe to a constituent assembly,
through which the nation will decide its own fate and choose the
organization of its own political life."</p>

<p>From later accounts it appears that no fighting of any sort ever took
place, or even threatened. A body of Caucasians and other soldiers of
other non-Slavic races, all Moslems and speaking no Russian, did
indeed appear near Petrograd, and created considerable alarm among
councils. Being met by a body of Government troops, a misunderstanding
arose and threats of arrest were exchanged. Then came some Caucasians
from Petrograd, loyal to the Provisional Government, and interpreted,
whereupon it appeared that the supposed rebels had heard of no
rebellion and had no intention of attacking. Nevertheless, much
capital was made of the incident at the time.</p>

<p>On the 14th General Kornilov was arrested or, rather, he gave himself
up to a commission of inquiry which arrived at Mogilev, and
henceforward little is heard from him. On the following day Kerensky
issued a proclamation definitely declaring Russia a republic, in the
following terms:</p>

<p>"General Kornilov's rebellion has been quelled, but great is the
confusion caused thereby and again great is the danger threatening the
Fatherland and its freedom. Holding it necessary to put an end to the
external indefiniteness of the state's organization, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>(p. 139)</span>
remembering the unanimous and rapturous approval of the republican
idea expressed at the Moscow Conference, the Provisional Government
declares that the constitutional organization, according to which the
Russian state is ruled, is a republican organization, and it hereby
proclaims the Russian Republic."</p>

<p>To this document Kerensky signed his name as "Minister and President,"
though the latter title may have referred to his presidency of the
Ministry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile almost daily changes were taking place in the personnel of
the Cabinet, members of which were resigning, withdrawing their
resignations and again resigning. Finally this body was reduced to
five members, with Kerensky still at the head, with practically
plenary powers. Every official utterance, whether by the premier or
any one of his associates, sounded one note: the need of stricter
discipline. Evidently there was now a genuine effort being made to
counteract the laxness which had been continually increasing since the
July defeat.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the name of Kaledine, the hetman of the Don
Cossacks, first began to appear prominently in the reports of events.
Kaledine had evidently shown himself in sympathy with Kornilov, for an
order was now sent to the Don Cossacks to arrest their chief and send
him on to Petrograd. To this demand the Cossacks returned an evasive
reply, saying that they were holding a congress at which the presence
of Kaledine as presiding officer was necessary. One of the
accusations against Kaledine was that he was attempting to organize a
separate government among his people in southern Russia.</p>

<p>During these exciting days the soldiers' and workmen's councils had
indeed given their full support to the Provisional Government against
the Kornilov movement. But if Kerensky had hoped thereby to silence
the voices of the extremists, the Bolsheviki, and to create solidarity
among the radical groups, he was to be strongly disappointed. The
effect was directly contrary; within the councils, and especially in
the Petrograd Council, there was a strong reaction in favor of the
extremists. For <span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>(p. 140)</span> at a meeting of that latter body, held in the
evening of the 13th, in which the policy of the Council was being
discussed, the Bolsheviki for the first time gained a substantial
majority, numbering 279 against 150. The resolution bringing out this
vote demanded the absolute exclusion from participation in the
government of all representatives of the propertied classes, with the
usual invitation to all the warring states to come together at a
general peace conference. Already the second counter-revolution was
lifting. Nor was the developing situation any more reassuring when, on
the 19th, Chiesde, Skobeliev, Tsertelli, Chernov and the rest of the
Executive Committee of the Petrograd Council resigned on account of
the majority vote polled by the Bolsheviki on the 13th.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from Finland and from the Ukraine, or Little Russia, came
rumors of secret conferences wherein was discussed the establishment
of separate governments. In Kiev was held a congress of non-Slavic
peoples inhabiting Russia, which declared for a "democratic federal
republic," in which the separate nationalities should each enjoy a
large measure of autonomy.</p>

<p>On September 28, 1917, there assembled in Petrograd what was known as
the "Democratic Congress," a conference called by the councils to
offset the Moscow Conference. About 1,200 delegates attended,
representing, first of all, the various provincial councils, then the
zemstvos, labor unions, cooperative societies, peasant organizations,
etc.</p>

<p>Kerensky spoke from the platform during the opening session, though
he made it plain that he did so in his private capacity, and not as
the representative of the Government, which, he declared, would
recognize no other authority than that of the Constituent Assembly,
when that should have been created.</p>

<p>His tone was aggressive, as though he were facing an opposition, and,
indeed, from the volume of the applause accorded him it was obvious
that he had only a minority heartily with him. He expressed himself
strongly in favor of a cabinet in which should be represented the
Constitutional Democrats, and he denounced the local council of
Helsingfors, which had refused to prevent the opening of the Finnish
Diet, which had been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>(p. 141)</span> forbidden by the Provisional Government,
for it was known that the Finns contemplated the declaration of a
separate state. At this point the speaker was hissed from the left.</p>

<p>"You may hiss, my friends," declared Kerensky, "but bear in mind that
a German fleet is moving up the Baltic."</p>

<p>At a later session a resolution was passed demanding that there should
be no change made in the Cabinet without consulting the Congress. In
open defiance of this order Kerensky, on October 4, 1917, completely
reorganized his Cabinet, appointing a number of Constitutional
Democrats. Three days later there was another reorganization of the
Cabinet, after a conference between representatives of the Democratic
Congress, the Constitutional Democrats and Premier Kerensky, in which
it seemed they had arrived at some sort of a compromise by which they
could work together.</p>

<p>One definite result of the Democratic Congress was the organization of
a sort of a makeshift constitutional assembly, called the "Temporary
Council of the Russian Republic," in which "nondemocratic elements
were to have 120 representatives."</p>

<p>At first the Congress insisted that the Cabinet should make itself
responsible to this body. This suggestion Kerensky and his associates
promptly refused to consider. Finally a compromise was effected by
which it was agreed that the temporary council should work together
with the Cabinet in an advisory capacity and should have certain
initiative powers.</p>

<p>This body was then organized and finally held its first meeting on
October 20, 1917.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Soldiers' and Workmen's Council had held an election to
fill the vacancies created by the resignation of most of its officers
and executive committee. What political complexion the Council had now
assumed may be judged from the fact that Leon Trotzky was elected to
the chairmanship. He and several of his political associates had also
been elected members of the Temporary Council, or Preliminary
Assembly, as it was also called, but this election they utilized only
as a means to making an effective demonstration, for at the first
session of the body Trotzky made a fiery speech denouncing the Cabinet
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span> and the Temporary Council itself as being in the hands of the
"bourgeoisie."</p>

<p>"We will have nothing to do with you!" he shouted. "We will go among
the soldiers and the workers and the peasants and tell them that you
are endangering the revolution." Having concluded, Trotzky and the
other Bolshevist members walked out in a body.</p>

<p>Whatever else may be said against the Bolsheviki, they do most
assuredly give their opponents sufficient warning of their intended
acts. In fact, so continuously did they declare their intention of
seizing the powers of government, even to fixing the date, that they
gave the superficial impression of being mere boasters.</p>

<p>After being elected chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, Trotzky caused
to be formed a military revolutionary committee. In the evening of
Sunday, November 4, 1917, a delegation from this committee appeared at
the Government staff offices and demanded the right of entry, control,
and veto. This demand was flatly refused.</p>

<p>"What you will not concede voluntarily we will take by force," replied
the delegates, and went. Thus the events beginning three days later
could have been no surprise to the Kerensky Government.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="title">THE BOLSHEVIST REVOLUTION</p>


<p>On November 7, 1917, the Bolsheviki took their first violent action.
An armed naval detachment, under orders from the military
revolutionary committee of the Soviet, which had established itself in
the Smolny Institute building, occupied the offices of the official
Petrograd Telegraph Agency and the Central Telegraph Office, the State
Bank and the Marie Palace, where the Preliminary Assembly was holding
its sessions. In a communication to the Municipal Duma, Trotzky stated
that it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>(p. 143)</span> was not the intention of the Soviet to seize full
power, but only to assume control of the city.</p>

<p>Kerensky immediately took measures to oppose these overt acts, but
within the next twenty-four hours it became obvious that he had little
support among the soldiers in the capital. By next morning he had
disappeared, fleeing, as was presently to develop, to the military
forces at the front, which he believed might be loyal to the
Government.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Trotzky declared the Preliminary Assembly dissolved and
issued a proclamation that it was the intention of the new government,
when established and in control, to open negotiations with the Germans
for a "general democratic peace."</p>

<p>As yet the Bolsheviki had not met with any serious opposition. Orders
issued by the Kerensky Government for the opening of the spans of the
bridge across the Neva were not carried out. Bolshevist patrols
paraded the streets and maintained order. A number of outbursts on the
part of the criminal elements, having as their object robbery and
looting, were severely suppressed and the ringleaders shot.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of the 8th the following proclamation was
issued:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>"To the Army Committees of the Active Army and to all Councils of
     Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates and to the Garrison and
     Proletariat of Petrograd:</p>

<p>"We have deposed the Government of Kerensky, which rose against
     the revolution and the people. The change which resulted in the
     deposition of the Provisional Government was accomplished without
     bloodshed. The Petrograd Council of Workmen's and Soldiers'
     Delegates solemnly welcomes the accomplished change and proclaims
     the authority of the Military Revolutionary Committee until the
     creation of a government by the Workmen's and Soldiers'
     Delegates. Announcing this to the army at the front, the
     Revolutionary Committee calls upon the revolutionary soldiers to
     watch closely the conduct of the men in command. Officers who do
     not join the accomplished <span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>(p. 144)</span> revolution immediately and
     openly must be arrested at once as enemies. The Petrograd Council
     of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates considers this to be the
     program of the new authority:</p>

<p>"First&mdash;The offer of an immediate democratic peace.</p>

<p>"Second&mdash;The immediate handing over of large proprietarial lands
     to the peasants.</p>

<p>"Third&mdash;The transmission of all authority to the Council of
     Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates.</p>

<p>"Fourth&mdash;The convocation of an honest Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p>"The national revolutionary army must not permit uncertain
     military detachments to leave the front for Petrograd. They
     should use persuasion, but where this fails they must oppose any
     such action on the part of such detachments by force without
     mercy.</p>

<p>"The actual order must be read immediately to all military
     detachments in all arms. The suppression of this order from the
     rank and file by the army organizations is equivalent to a great
     crime against the revolution and will be punished by all the
     strength behind the revolutionary law.</p>

<p>"Soldiers! For peace, for bread, for land, and for the power of
     the people!</p>

<p class="right10">"<span class="smcap">The Military Revolutionary Committee.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, simultaneously with the uprising, a General Congress of the
Soviets of all Russia convened. When Trotzky had stated that there was
no intention to take over the powers of the government, he had spoken
only for the Petrograd Soviet. This Congress was responsible for the
more ambitious program.</p>

<p>Of the 560 members of the Congress, 250 were Bolsheviki, 150 Social
Revolutionists, 60 were Minimalists, or Socialists of the Kerensky
type, while the rest belonged to the various other minor radical
groups.</p>

<p>The order of business for the Congress was:</p>

<p>First&mdash;Organization of Power.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Peace and War.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;A Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p>Among the officers elected were Lenine and Trotzky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>(p. 145)</span> The Minimalists immediately presented a motion proposing a
working compromise with the Kerensky Government, but this was voted
down.</p>

<p>The general result of the first session of the Congress was approval
of the action of the Petrograd Soviet and the declaration of a new
revolutionary government through the Congress. The Bolshevist element
were triumphant, completely so.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="title">THE SIEGE OF THE WINTER PALACE</p>


<p>The new government was not to gain control without some fighting,
however. When the forces of the Soviet attempted to take possession of
the Winter Palace, the headquarters of the Kerensky Government, they
found the building in possession of a military force determined to
give some resistance. Among the troops stationed here was the Women's
Regiment, the Death Battalion, whose fame had been spread all over the
world. The women immediately surrendered without firing a shot. It
seems highly probable that this body was never intended for fighting,
and that its surrender was with the full consent of the defenders
within the building. The women were marched off and later disarmed;
then the fighting began.</p>

<p>Within the square before the palace were stacked great quantities of
firewood. Behind these woodpiles the Bolshevist forces immediately
took shelter and opened up a steady fire at the windows of the palace.</p>

<p>Eventually, later in the night, the defenders of the Winter Palace
surrendered.</p>

<p>Next day the bullet-spattered palace, the only visible sign of the
revolution, drew vast throngs of the populace to the vicinity of the
structure. On the Nevsky Prospect, where machine guns and armored cars
and infantry had been massed were to be seen only the usual moving
throng of pedestrians, among whom <span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>(p. 146)</span> might be seen an occasional
bandaged soldier or sailor, who had been wounded during the fight. Of
the defenders of the Winter Palace about thirty had been killed or
wounded, while the forces of the Soviet had lost only one sailor
killed and several were wounded.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that dispatches were announcing that the
Bolsheviki were in a majority only in Petrograd, similar uprisings
were taking place all over Russia, notably in Moscow. There the
fighting seems to have been of a more determined nature, however, the
casualties amounting to seven hundred on both sides. Eventually the
Bolsheviki were triumphant.</p>

<p>After Kerensky left Petrograd, he managed, a few days later, to obtain
the support of a small force of Cossacks, numbering three or four
thousand, under General Krasnov, and with these he began an advance on
Petrograd, reaching Gatchina, a few miles distant. Here he was joined
by an additional force of military cadets, some light and heavy
artillery, and an armored train.</p>

<p>Here he was attacked on Saturday, the 10th, and the fighting which
then began lasted until Monday night. The Bolshevist forces included
four of the famous Petrograd guard regiments, several battalions of
sailors from the fleet, and a large number of armed workmen, known as
the Red Guard.</p>

<p>"Our forces," reported a Bolshevist colonel, "were under a continuous
shell fire, and many of our men were wounded, though few were killed.
At one time a squadron of Kerensky's Cossacks attempted a charge near
Tsarskoe Selo. They evidently were not familiar with the fact that
officers of veteran regiments were with the Bolshevist forces, and, to
their surprise, they were met by organized resistance. A heavy volley,
which toppled over many of their horses, caused them severe losses.
This was the last active attempt of the Kerensky forces to attack, and
afterward they retreated."</p>

<p>Later reports seemed to indicate that the fighting had not been very
severe and that the commander of the Kerensky forces, General Krasnov,
was only half-hearted in his support of the former Premier. Or it may
have been the attitude of his own soldiers which compelled him to
begin parleying with the Bolshevist <span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>(p. 147)</span> commander, the result of
which was that the Cossacks joined the forces of the latter. General
Krasnov joined them and made the following report regarding Kerensky:</p>

<p>"At 3 o'clock in the afternoon of November 1 (November 14, new style)
I called at Kerensky's headquarters. He appeared nervous and excited.</p>

<p>"'General,' he said to me, 'you have betrayed me. Your Cossacks say
they will arrest me and hand me over to the sailors.'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I answered, 'such a discussion is now going on.'</p>

<p>"'Do the officers feel the same way?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'What shall I do? Will I have to commit suicide?'</p>

<p>"'If you are an honest man you will go to Petrograd under a white flag
and appear before the Revolutionary Committee, where you will
negotiate as head of the Government.'</p>

<p>"Kerensky agreed to this and he was promised a guard. He objected to a
guard of sailors on the ground that he had enemies among them. He
wanted to wait until night, but finally agreed to go in daytime. I
ordered Colonel Kishkov, of the Tenth Don Cossacks, to appoint a guard
of eight men. A half hour later the Cossacks told me that Kerensky
could not be found. I raised the alarm, thinking he could not have
left Gatchina."</p>

<p>It is evident that Kerensky could not trust himself to the Bolshevist
leaders. There were rumors, but no authentic news came as to his
whereabouts. Some reports placed him in Siberia; others with the
Cossacks in southern Russia.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="title">THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THEIR LEADERS</p>


<p>But before the final defeat of the Kerensky forces the Bolsheviki had
consolidated their hold on the political situation and had organized a
government. Most of the ministers of the former Kerensky Cabinet had
been arrested and were imprisoned <span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>(p. 148)</span> in the St. Peter and St.
Paul Fortress; they were with the forces which had defended the Winter
Palace. On the occasion of their arrest Trotzky made the statement
that they would be tried for complicity in the Kornilov revolution, or
attempt at revolution, indicating that the Bolsheviki took the
attitude that the affair had been the result of an intrigue of
Kerensky's.</p>

<p>Nikolai Lenine, whose return to Russia at the beginning of the
Revolution had been effected with the aid of Germany, headed the new
cabinet as Premier. Leon Trotzky, who posed as an internationalist,
was assigned the Department of Foreign Affairs. It may be well to
discuss briefly the origin and aims of the political party which had
suddenly achieved control.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviki are simply a faction of the Socialist party which may
be found in every country where the Socialists are organized. In the
United States they are known as the "Impossibilists," signifying that
they will accept no compromise in their struggle against capitalism,
as compared to their more moderate opponents, the "Opportunists," who
are not averse to playing politics with the more conservative parties.
In Russia the Bolsheviki are the "Impossibilists," the word Bolshevik
being derived from "Bolsho," meaning large, or great. Literally the
name indicates "all or nothing." The word was first coined in the
summer of 1903, when the split in the Russian Social Democratic party
occurred at a general convention, Lenine heading the secessionist
movement. It is claimed that the Maximalists of the Social
Revolutionists who, during the turbulent period that began in 1904,
advocated violent expropriation and committed robberies against the
Government to obtain funds, were a different faction.</p>

<p>Fundamentally the Bolsheviki are Marxian Socialists, believing that
all history is simply a record of the varying phases of the eternal
class struggle between the ruling classes and the oppressed
proletariat. Compared to this struggle, between the rulers and the
ruled, all other struggles, even the present war, are to them of no
significance; they consider them simply quarrels between the
capitalist groups of the various countries, while <span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>(p. 149)</span> the
soldiers forming the armies of the various belligerents are simply&mdash;so
the Bolsheviki believe&mdash;dupes. From the same point of view, if these
dupes, the working classes of all nations, were really
"class-conscious," realizing their true interests, they would
understand that nationalism and patriotism are only tricks of the
ruling classes to keep them separated, so that they may be all the
more easily controlled.</p>

<p>Theoretically all Socialists of the Marxian school believe this. But
when the present war broke out, such Socialists as Kerensky and
Tchernov and a great many more in this country, England and France
were convinced that the situation was exceptional and that, though the
Allied countries were, not, from their point of view, thoroughly
democratic, in that the industries are controlled by private persons
for private profit, they did, nevertheless, relatively speaking,
represent democracy as against such rank autocracy as the German and
Austrian Governments.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviki, true to their name, would grant no such concessions.
All governments, in their eyes, were against the people, the
difference between them being only a question of degree so slight as
not to matter materially. The real fight, according to their opinion,
is between the great masses of the workers on the one hand and the
exploiting traders and other capitalists on the other. Therefore they
called on the masses of all countries to unite in a great world-wide
brotherhood and overthrow all the governments.</p>

<p>The intellect, the chief exponent, of the Russian Bolsheviki was and
is Vladimir Illitch Ulyanov or, as he is more generally known, Nikolai
Lenine. He was born in Simbirsk, central Russia, forty-eight years
ago, being a scion of the minor landed nobility. His father was an
official in the Department of Public Instruction and Lenine received
his early education in his native city. After graduating from the
local gymnasium he went to Petrograd where he continued his studies in
the university, specializing in economics. The early and the
picturesque phase of the Nihilist movement was past then, but its seed
was sprouting and very many students were radicals and revolutionists,
Lenine among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>(p. 150)</span> But what made Lenine more determined in his revolutionary
activities was a tragedy which happened in the family when he was only
seventeen years of age. It was then, in 1887, that his elder brother,
also a student in the Petrograd University, was arrested for suspected
complicity in a revolutionary plot and, after a secret trial, was
condemned to death and hung.</p>

<p>Like all men of his type, Lenine was intensely emotional and this
tragedy in his life made a deep impression on him and was probably one
of the chief factors in determining him to devote his whole career to
the revolutionary movement. By this time he had become a convert to
the Socialist theories of Karl Marx, and thenceforth he spent all his
spare time spreading the propaganda among the working people. At the
same time he also continued his studies of economics and various
kindred subjects. At the age of twenty-five he published his first
essay, "The Economic Significance of the People's Movement." Four
years later appeared a historical treatise, "The Development of
Capitalism in Russia," just at the moment when two important factions
in the general revolutionary movement were carrying on a controversy
as to whether the economic development of Russia would be the same as
in western Europe. Even as the result of mere research the work was a
scholarly masterpiece and was regarded as one of the landmarks in the
literature of Russian industrial development.</p>

<p>It was not long before Lenine's activities caused him to become
involved with the police, and not only was he compelled to change his
name often, as did all revolutionists, but he was finally forced to
leave Russia and could only return on short visits on false passports.
Most of his time abroad was spent in Switzerland, France, and Austria.</p>

<p>Naturally, he took an active part in the disturbances of 1905, but did
not specially distinguish himself, as it was the Social Revolutionists
with their program of terrorism who were the most energetic during
that period. Then followed the reaction and little was heard of Lenine
or his Bolsheviki for a while. But in 1911, when Russian revolutionary
activities showed signs of reawakening, Lenine and his associates
founded the prominent <span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>(p. 151)</span> Socialist daily paper, "Pravda," and
took up their propaganda work with renewed activity. In 1913 the
Leninites had developed such strength that they were able to elect six
representatives to the Duma.</p>

<p>When the war broke out Lenine was in Cracow. He was immediately
arrested by the Austrians as a Russian subject, but it was a moment
when his past career stood him in good turn, and he was easily able to
prove himself an enemy of the Russian Government. Being released, he
went to Switzerland, where he remained until March, 1917. On the
outbreak of the revolution which resulted in the overthrow of the Czar
he at once set out for Russia. The Germans were only too glad to offer
him facilities for crossing over to Russian territory, for they were
well acquainted with his antiwar theories and had every reason to hope
that he would play their game in the Russian capital.</p>

<p>But if Lenine was the scholar, the theorist, of the Bolsheviki, the
dynamic power was undoubtedly Leon Trotzky. His real name is Leber
Braunstein, and as the name indicates, he is of Jewish origin. He was
born in Kherson, a province bordering on the Black Sea, about
forty-five years ago. Of well-to-do parents, he obtained an excellent
university education and, like Lenine, became active among the
university revolutionary societies.</p>

<p>During the disturbances in 1905 he was at the head of the Workmen's
Council which directed the general strike, but after the attempted
revolution had been suppressed he was arrested and exiled to Siberia.
After a few years he escaped by way of Japan, thence to Europe, where
he became a familiar figure in the Russian exile colonies in
Switzerland and other European countries.</p>

<p>When the war broke out he was in Berlin. Not liking his brand of
Socialism for home consumption, the German Government sent him across
the frontier into Switzerland. But Switzerland proved too quiet for a
man of his turbulent temperament, so he managed to find his way to
Paris, where he began publishing a Socialist paper. Here he was
allowed to remain until the Russian troops were sent to France. His
paper fell into the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>(p. 152)</span> hands of the Russian soldiers. Trotzky's
doctrines were quite as uncompromising as were those of Lenine, so, at
the suggestion of the Russian Government, he was requested to move on.
He thereupon went to Spain. But the Spanish Government would not
tolerate a man of his radical opinions, so he was put aboard a steamer
bound for Cuba. From Havana he at once took passage to New York, where
he received a cordial welcome from the radical Jewish elements,
landing in January, 1917.</p>

<p>During the three months that Trotzky remained in New York he lived in
the Bronx section of the city, his friends supplying him with the
furniture for a small flat. As a means of livelihood he wrote
editorials for the Socialist Jewish papers and was one of the editors
of "Novy Mir," a Russian paper published in New York. He also wrote
articles for the German Socialist paper, the "Volkszeitung."</p>

<p>Shortly after the news of the March revolution in Petrograd Trotzky,
together with a number of other exiles, took passage for home. At
Halifax he was taken off the ship by the British authorities, who knew
his record. Here he was detained until, at the request of the Kerensky
Government, he was released and allowed to proceed to his destination.
In Petrograd he joined Lenine and was the executive head of the
Bolsheviki.</p>

<p>Of the domestic, the internal, program of the Bolsheviki little need
be said, for it could not be brought into effective application until
the international problems should be solved. Like other Socialists,
they stand for the collective ownership of all public industries and
natural resources, including the land. It is part of their doctrine
that the big estates of the church and the bigger landlords who live
off their rents should be expropriated at once. They hold that all
army officers should be elected; that once elected, they should be
respected and obeyed so far as military organization is concerned, but
they should be made subject to sudden recall, or ejection. Unlike many
Socialists, the Bolsheviki do not believe in centralization, even in a
democratic government. In other words, they are keen partisans of
"states' rights," and believe in local autonomy, superimposed by loose
federation. For this reason, they recognize the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>(p. 153)</span> right of
secession on the part of any distinct section of the people who may
have special sectional interests, such as radical, religious or
national interests.</p>

<p>These are the general principles underlying the Bolshevik movement,
apart from the sinister leadership of Trotzky and Lenine, whose
treacherous connection with Germany and German gold finally betrayed
their party as well as their country and her Allies.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="title">FIRST BOLSHEVIKI PEACE MOVE</p>


<p>The first informal notice of the peace negotiations which the
Bolsheviki proposed to initiate was issued on November 20, 1917, when
the following announcement was issued:</p>

<p>"By order of the All-Russian Workmen's and Soldiers' Congress, the
'Council of the People's Commissaries' had assumed power, with
obligation to offer all the peoples and their respective governments
an immediate armistice on all fronts, with the purpose of opening
pourparlers immediately for the conclusion of a 'democratic peace.'</p>

<p>"When the power of the Council is firmly established throughout the
country, the Council will, without delay, make a formal offer of an
armistice to all the belligerents, enemy and ally. A draft message to
this effect has been sent to all the people's commissaries for foreign
affairs and to all the plenipotentiaries and representatives of Allied
nations in Petrograd.</p>

<p>"The Council also has sent orders to the citizen commander in chief
that, after receiving the present message, he shall approach the
commanding authorities of the enemy armies with an offer of a
cessation of hostilities for the purpose of opening peace pourparlers,
and that he shall, first, keep the Council constantly informed by
direct wire of pourparlers with the enemy armies and, second, that he
shall sign the preliminary act only after approval by the Commissaries
Council."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>(p. 154)</span> These instructions were, in fact, sent that same day to
General Dukhonin, who had assumed command of the armies at the front
since Kerensky's disappearance and seemed to be well inclined toward
the new régime, since he had given out an order forbidding the
movements of any troops toward Petrograd. But Dukhonin made no
response to the above instructions. Finally, three days later, on the
23d, Lenine and Krylenko, the "Commissary of War," got into direct
telephone communication with Dukhonin, and asked the meaning of his
silence and whether he intended to obey the instructions.</p>

<p>"Before replying," returned Dukhonin, "I would like information on the
following points: Has the Council of the People's Commissaries had an
answer from the Powers to its appeal to belligerent nations regarding
a peace decree? Is it intended to open negotiations regarding an
armistice, and with whom&mdash;only with Germans or with Turks&mdash;or are
negotiations to be opened for a general truce?"</p>

<p>"These are questions not to be decided by you," replied Lenine; "all
that remains for you is to obey instructions."</p>

<p>"I can only understand," replied Dukhonin, "that immediate
negotiations with the Powers are impossible for us; still less are
they possible for me in your name. Only the central Government,
supported by the army and the country, can have sufficient weight with
our enemy to make such negotiations authoritative and to secure
results. I, also, consider that it is to the interest of Russia that a
general peace should be concluded as soon as possible. But I repeat
that the peace necessary for Russia can only be concluded by the
central Government."</p>

<p>The reply to this expression of opinion was:</p>

<p>"In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic and of the
Council of the People's Commissaries, we dismiss you from your post
for disobeying the Government's orders and for conduct that brings
unheard-of calamities to the working classes of all countries, and
especially to the armies. Krylenko is appointed commander in chief."</p>

<p>A proclamation was immediately issued, addressed to the army and the
navy, authorizing regiments at the front to elect <span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>(p. 155)</span> delegates
to open negotiations with the enemy, though the power to sign an
agreement for an armistice could only be exercised by the Council in
Petrograd. The soldiers were urged not to allow their generals to
stand between them and the attainment of their ends. Care should be
taken, however, that they should be in no danger from unlawful
violence. They were urged to maintain the strictest military
discipline.</p>

<p>On the following day Trotzky sent a notification of the effort being
made to open negotiations with the Germans to the ambassadors of the
Allied nations, the text of which was as follows:</p>

<p>"I herewith have the honor to inform you, Monsieur Ambassador, that
the All-Russian Congress of Soldiers' and Workmen's Delegates has
organized a new Government in the form of a Council of National
Commissioners. The head of this Government is Vladimir Illitch Lenine.
The direction of the foreign policy has been intrusted to me in the
capacity of National Commissioner of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>"Drawing your attention to the text of an offer of an armistice and a
democratic peace on the basis of no annexations or indemnities and the
self-determination of nations, approved by the All-Russian Congress
of Soldiers' and Workmen's Delegates, I have the honor to beg you to
regard the above document as a formal offer of an immediate armistice
on all fronts and the immediate opening of peace negotiations&mdash;an
offer with which the authoritative Government of the Russian Republic
has addressed itself simultaneously to all the belligerent peoples and
their governments.</p>

<p>"Accept my assurances, Monsieur Ambassador, of the profound respect of
the Soldiers' and Workmen's Government for the people of France, which
cannot help aiming at peace, as well as all the rest of the nations,
exhausted and made bloodless by this unexampled slaughter."</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>(p. 156)</span> CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="title">THE PEACE PARLEYS BEGIN</p>


<p>At four o'clock in the afternoon of November 28, 1917, a Russian
delegation crossed over into the German lines under a flag of truce
and asked the German commander of that sector to communicate their
request for immediate negotiations for an armistice to German
headquarters.</p>

<p>The official Russian report of this first parley was as follows:</p>

<p>"We crossed the line, preceded by a trumpeter carrying a white flag.
Three hundred yards short of the German entanglements we were met by
German officers. Our eyes were blindfolded and we were conducted to a
battalion staff of the German army, where we handed over our
credentials to two officers of the German General Staff, who had been
sent to meet us.</p>

<p>"The conversation was in French. Our proposals to carry on
negotiations for an armistice on all the fronts as a preliminary to a
general peace were immediately handed over to the staff of the
division, whence it was sent by direct wire to the staff commander of
the eastern front and to the chief in command of the German armies.</p>

<p>"At 6.20 we were taken in a motor car to the Minister's house on the
Dvinsk-Ponevyezh road, where we were received by the Divisional
General von Hoffmeister, who informed us that our proposal had been
handed to the highest commander, and that a reply would probably be
received within twenty-four hours. But at 7.30 the first answer from
the chief of the general command already had been received, announcing
agreement to our proposals, and leaving the details of the next
meeting to General von Hoffmeister and the parliamentarians. After an
exchange of opinion and further communication by wire from the chief
of the general command, at midnight a written answer to our proposal
was given to us by Von Hoffmeister. In view of the fact that ours was
written in Russian, the answer was given in German. The reply was:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>(p. 157)</span> "'The chief of the German eastern front is prepared to enter
into negotiations with the Russian chief command. The chief of the
German eastern front is authorized by the German commander in chief to
carry on negotiations for an armistice. The chief of the Russian
armies is requested to appoint a commission with written authority to
be sent to the headquarters of the commander of the German eastern
front. On his side the German commander likewise will name a
commission with special authorization.</p>

<p>"'The day and the hour of the meeting are to be fixed by the Russian
commander in chief. It is demanded that the German commander be warned
in due time to prepare a special train for the purpose. Notice must be
given at which part it is intended to cross the line. The commander of
the German eastern front will place at the disposition of the Russian
commission the necessary apparatus, so that it may keep in
communication with its chief command.'</p>

<p>"The Russian parliamentarians decided to appoint as the place the
junction of the Dvinsk-Vilna line, whence the Russian representatives
will be conducted to the Brest-Litovsk headquarters of the German
commander. The time appointed is midnight of December 2, 1917. At the
same time we were informed that no firing would occur unless prompted,
and that enemy fraternization would be stopped. We were blindfolded
again and conducted to our lines."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the elections for the Constituent Assembly had been called,
and on November 26, 1917, the returns for Petrograd were made public.
It was announced that the Bolsheviki polled 272,000 votes, the
Constitutional Democrats 211,000 and the Social Revolutionists
116,000. There was considerable discrepancy between this report and
others which were issued through various press agencies, though in all
the Bolsheviki were the leading party, but they still fell far short
of a working majority. They obtained six seats, the Constitutional
Democrats four and the Social Revolutionists two. Later reports
covering the elections as a whole indicated that the Bolsheviki polled
about 40 or 45 per cent. of the total vote.</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>(p. 158)</span> CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="title">PUBLICATION OF SECRET TREATIES</p>


<p>It was during this period, before the end of the month, that Trotsky
carried out his threat to publish all the secret state documents,
consisting largely of the treaties agreed to between the old Russian
autocracy and the other Entente governments.</p>

<p>The first of these was an official communication from Russia to the
Allies expressing the desire of the Russian Government to acquire the
Dardanelles, Constantinople and the west shore of the Bosporus, also
certain limited territories over in Asia Minor. In reply France and
England demanded that Russia agree to the freedom of Constantinople
for cargoes not to or from Russian ports, the independence of certain
Mussulman territories in Arabia, and the right of England to include
certain parts of Persia under her sphere of influence. The Russian
sphere of influence was also defined, and an agreement regarding the
northern boundary of Afghanistan was discussed.</p>

<p>In the second installment of published documents was a telegram from
the Russian ambassador in France, Izvolsky, dated March 11, 1917,
indicating France's recognition of Russia's right to define her own
western frontiers. This was followed by a telegram from Sergius
Sazonov, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, assuring Izvolsky of
Russia's approval of the agreement with England and France regarding
Constantinople and the Dardanelles, and also stated the willingness of
Russia to give France and England the right to define the western
frontiers of Germany, but insisted on the exclusion of the Polish
question for international discussion. There was also reference to the
future exclusion of Germany from the Chinese markets, which was held
subject to further discussion with Japan.</p>

<p>Another series of documents, published December 1, 1917, related to
the concessions which had been offered Greece to bring her into accord
with the Allies. One of these offered Greece <span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>(p. 159)</span> all of Albania
south of Avlona; another defined concessions in Asia Minor at the
expense of Turkey. Another document discussed the handing over of
Kavala to the Bulgarians on condition that they join the Allies.</p>

<p>One document referred to a conference of financiers held in
Switzerland, in which the German delegates insisted that the Baltic
Russian provinces should be ceded to Germany, and Finland should
become an independent state. Another telegram, sent by the Russian
ambassador at Rome on October 31, 1917, expressed a desire on the part
of the Italians to have the Russians relieve the pressure on the
Italian front by creating a diversion on the Galician front.</p>

<p>There was also published the text of a treaty between France, Great
Britain, Italy, and Russia, whereby Italy was promised certain
territories for joining the Alliance; also, Italy was to disregard all
attempts on the part of the Pope to bring about peace discussions.
Italy, according to another agreement, was to have the active
assistance of the British and French fleets in destroying the
Austrians on the Adriatic. After peace Italy was to receive the
Trentino or southern Tyrol to the Brenner Pass, Trieste, Istria, and
Dalmatia. In case Albania should be granted independence, it should be
under the protection of Italy, but Italy should not oppose should it
be decided to apportion parts of Albania to Montenegro, Serbia, and
Greece. The agreement also recognized the principle of Italian control
of the balance of naval power in the Mediterranean. Italy was also to
have rights in Libia enjoyed by the Sultan on the basis of the Treaty
of Lausanne, but Italy agreed to recognize the right of independence
of those Mussulman territories including sacred places. Should France
and Great Britain increase their African colonial possessions, Italy
should have the right to increase hers at the cost of Turkey. On the
whole, it will be obvious that Trotzky's promise of sensational
revelations fell rather flat. The main features of all these treaties
and agreements had been common knowledge before.</p>

<p>During the last days of November, 1917, the press dispatches seemed to
indicate the possibility of a counter-revolution against <span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>(p. 160)</span> the
Bolsheviki within a very brief time. It was reported that the more
conservative elements were organizing and were preparing to assert
themselves. Much significance especially was attached to the action of
the Cossack General Kaledine, who had declared the territory of his
people, in the south of Russia, an independent state with headquarters
at Rostov. It was said that he controlled the coal fields of Russia
and would be able to force the Bolsheviki to terms economically. But
subsequent events seem to indicate that these dispatches pictured the
hopes of their senders, rather than actual facts, for gradual
recognition of the authority of the Lenine-Trotzky Government was
spreading and deepening. By the first days of December, 1917, the
Bolsheviki were in full control of army headquarters, at Mogilev.
General Dukhonin did, indeed, protest their authority, but obviously
he had no support from the rank and file of his men, for the
Bolsheviki, under Abram Krylenko, their new military chief, took
possession without bloodshed. General Dukhonin himself was killed,
under circumstances described by Krylenko himself in his official
report, as follows:</p>

<p>"I cannot be silent on the sad act of lynch law practiced upon the
former highest commander in chief, General Dukhonin. Popular hatred
surpassed the limits of reason, and in spite of all attempts to save
him, he was thrown out of a railroad train at the Mogilev station and
killed. The flight of General Kornilov, the day before the fall of
headquarters, was the cause of this excess. I cannot allow the banner
of the revolution to be stained, and it is necessary strongly to
condemn such acts. A revolutionary people are fearful in a struggle,
but they should be soft after victory."</p>

<p>The tendency of the old Russian Empire to break up into separate and
independent territories, or nationalities, which had been manifesting
itself even during the days of the Kerensky régime, now showed itself
in its full course. As already stated, the Bolshevist program was
favorable to this tendency as a matter of fundamental principle,
therefore no effort was made to check it, other than to give support
to the Bolshevist elements in the seceded territories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>(p. 161)</span> On the outbreak of the revolution a committee had been
elected by the Soviets in Kiev, the metropolis of Little Russia, or
the Ukraine, to "safeguard the revolution." The military staff in Kiev
attempted to suppress this organization, but troops arriving from the
Galician front upheld the committee and the military staff was forced
to flee. Thereupon all power, civil and military, was vested in this
committee.</p>

<p>On November 26, 1917, the temporary popular assembly, which had
meanwhile been called together, known as the Rada, proclaimed itself
the supreme authority throughout Ukrainia, and elections were called
for a legitimate constituent assembly. This new republic covered a
vast territory, including some of the best agricultural sections of
Russia; the governments of Kherson, Ekaterinoslav, Kharkov, Taurida,
and parts of the governments of Voronesh and Kursk; it extended to the
Black Sea, Odessa, and the Crimea, and eastward to the territory of
the Don Cossacks, where Kaledine had organized his people. At least
part of the Black Sea fleet attached itself to the Ukraine Government,
recognizing its authority.</p>

<p>But the Ukraine Government, though revolutionary, was not Bolshevist.
Here the Bolsheviki did not gain control, though they continued the
same agitation which had been carried on up in Petrograd for so many
months. Occasionally there were open attacks and violent fighting
between the two factions, in which the Bolsheviki from the Great
Russian sections assisted them, giving the general impression that the
two republics were at war and raising the hope in the Allied countries
that, through the triumph of the Ukrainians, assisted by the Cossacks,
the Bolsheviki and their peace policy would yet be ousted. But, as
subsequent events have since shown, there was no less danger of a
separate peace on the part of the conservative Ukrainians than from
the Bolsheviki.</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>(p. 162)</span> CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="title">THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS</p>


<p>Meanwhile the Central Powers were responding to the Russian proposals
for peace negotiations with poorly concealed avidity. On November 30,
1917, Czernin, the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, replied to the
Russian proposals as follows:</p>

<p>"The guiding principles announced by the Russian Government for
negotiations for an armistice and a peace treaty, counterproposals to
which are awaited by the Russian Government, are, in the opinion of
the Austro-Hungarian Government, a suitable basis for entering upon
these negotiations. The Austro-Hungarian Government therefore declares
that it is ready to enter upon negotiations as proposed by the Russian
Government regarding an immediate armistice and a general peace."</p>

<p>Thus Austria-Hungary was the first government to extend to the
Lenine-Trotzky Cabinet official recognition.</p>

<p>The Allied representatives, in protesting against the peace
negotiations which had already been initiated, had addressed
themselves to the commander in chief at Mogilev. So much did Trotzky
resent this attitude that he issued the following warning on November
30, 1917:</p>

<p>"The Government cannot permit Allied diplomatic and military agents
to interfere in the internal affairs of our country and attempt to
excite war. Further steps in this direction will result in the gravest
complications, responsibility for which the Government now disclaims."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Trotzky did not confine his attacks to Russia's allies.
On the same day, while addressing the Soviet meeting, he made some
extended remarks regarding the impending negotiations.</p>

<p>"We shall be on our guard in the negotiations," he said, "and will not
permit distortion of those principles of universal peace for which the
Russian revolution is fighting. We shall allow <span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>(p. 163)</span> no evasions
and will make most categorical demands, both to our allies and to our
enemies.... In no case shall we allow a wrong interpretation of our
principles for a general peace. We shall confront our enemies with
questions which will admit of no ambiguous answers. Every word spoken
by us or by them will be written down and sent by wireless to all
nations, who will be the judges of our negotiations. Under the
influence of the working classes the German and Austrian Governments
have agreed to place themselves in the dock. Be assured, comrades,
that the prosecuting attorney, in the persons of the Russian
revolutionary delegation, will speak with thunderous accusation
against the diplomacy of all imperialists. It is all the same to us
how the Allied and enemy imperialists treat us. We will carry on our
independent class policy whatever they do.... Our Allies and our
enemies must learn once for all that the Czars, the Kerenskys and the
Miliukovs have passed...."</p>

<p>On December 2, 1917, as agreed, the Russian peace delegates again
crossed the lines and were escorted to Brest-Litovsk by the Germans,
where the first session of the conference was opened. Three days later
the Russian official version of the conference was issued from
Petrograd:</p>

<p>"The conference opened in the presence of the representatives of
Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria. Field Marshal von
Hindenburg and Field Marshal Hoetzendorf charged Prince Leopold of
Bavaria with the negotiations, and he in his turn nominated his chief
of staff, General Hoffmann. Other delegates received similar
authority from their highest commander in chief. The enemy declaration
was exclusively military.</p>

<p>"Our delegates opened the conference with a declaration of our peace
aims, in view of which an armistice was proposed. The enemy delegates
replied that that was a question to be solved by the politicians. They
said they were soldiers, having powers only to negotiate conditions of
an armistice, and could add nothing to the declaration of Foreign
Ministers Czernin and Von Kühlmann.</p>

<p>"Our delegates, taking note of this evasive declaration, proposed that
they should immediately address all the countries <span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>(p. 164)</span> involved in
the war, including Germany and her allies, and all States not
represented at the conference, with a proposal to take part in drawing
up the terms of an armistice on all fronts.</p>

<p>"The enemy delegates again replied evasively that they did not possess
such powers. Our delegation then proposed that they ask their
governments for such authority. This proposal was accepted, but no
reply had been communicated to the Russian delegation up to 2 o'clock,
December 5, 1917.</p>

<p>"Our representatives submitted a project for an armistice on all
fronts elaborated by our military experts. The principal points of
this project were: first, an interdiction against sending forces on
our fronts to the fronts of our allies, and, second, the retirement of
German detachments from the islands around Moon Sound.</p>

<p>"The enemy delegation submitted a project for an armistice on the
front from the Baltic to the Black Sea. This project is now being
examined by our military experts. Negotiations will be continued
to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>"The enemy delegation declared that our conditions for an armistice
were unacceptable, and expressed the opinion that such demands should
be addressed only to a conquered country."</p>

<p>On December 6, 1917, a slightly different version of the conference
was issued by the German Government, as follows:</p>

<p>"Yesterday the authorized representatives of the chief army
administrations of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria
concluded in writing with the authorized representatives of the
Russian chief army administration a suspension of hostilities for ten
days for the whole of the mutual fronts. The beginning is fixed for
Friday noon. The ten days' period will be utilized for bringing to a
conclusion negotiations for an armistice. For the purpose of reporting
verbally regarding the present results, a portion of the members of
the Russian deputation has returned home. The sittings of the
commission continue."</p>

<p>On this same day, December 6, 1917, Trotzky sent to all the Allied
embassies in Petrograd a note intimating that the armistice
negotiations with the Central Powers and the initiative of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>(p. 165)</span>
the Russian delegation had been suspended for seven days for the
purpose of providing opportunity for informing the peoples and the
governments of the Entente nations of the existence and the details of
such negotiations and their tendency. The note added that the
armistice would be signed only on condition that the Central Powers
agreed not to transfer troops from the front affected by the armistice
to the other fronts where fighting was still in progress, and that the
German troops evacuated the islands around Moon Sound. The note
concluded with:</p>

<p>"The period of delay thus given, even in the existing disturbed
condition of international communication, is amply sufficient to
afford the Allied Governments opportunity to define their attitude
toward the peace negotiations&mdash;that is, their willingness or refusal
to participate in negotiations for an armistice and peace. In case of
refusal they must declare clearly and definitely before all mankind
the aims for which the peoples of Europe may be called to shed their
blood during the fourth year of the war."</p>

<p>To this communication the Allied Governments made no official reply.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="title">AN ATTEMPTED COUNTER-REVOLUTION</p>


<p>It will be noted that one of the outstanding characteristics of the
Bolshevist Government was the publicity with which it carried on all
its business. A history of the Bolshevist régime might almost be
compiled from the proclamations of Trotzky alone. Even facts and
events which one might suppose would be advantageously suppressed are
announced. It was this policy which gave significance to the rumors of
an attempt on the part of the conservative elements, backed by the
Cossacks, to overthrow the Bolsheviki, for on December 7, 1917,
Trotzky issued a proclamation, or announcement, stating that "Generals
Kaledine and Kornilov, assisted by the imperialists and Constitutional
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>(p. 166)</span> Democrats and bourgeoisie," were precipitating a
counter-revolution and were "raising a revolt in the Don region
against the people and the revolution."</p>

<p>"The Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates," added the announcement, "have
ordered the necessary movements of troops against the
counter-revolution and issued decrees authorizing the local
revolutionary garrisons to attack the enemies of the people without
awaiting orders from the supreme authorities and forbidding any
attempts at mediation."</p>

<p>Kornilov, according to previous reports, had escaped from his
confinement at military headquarters at Mogilev the day before the
surrender to Krylenko, together with an escort of four or five hundred
Cossacks, and apparently he had succeeded in reaching the territory of
the Don Cossacks, where Kaledine had established his authority.</p>

<p>Further details indicated that Kaledine and his forces were advancing
against Ekatrinoslav, Kharkov, and Moscow. In the province of Orenburg
the Bolsheviki were attacked by General Dutov, at the head of an army
of Ural Cossacks, and he was now besieging Tcheliabinsk, an important
railroad junction. In the Caucasus General Karaulov was reported to be
attacking at two important points.</p>

<p>"While representatives of the Congress of Workmen's and Soldiers'
Delegates," continued Trotzky's announcement, "and the Congress of
Peasants' Deputies were negotiating to secure an honorable peace for
the exhausted country, the enemies of the people, the imperialists,
the bankers, the landowners, and their allies, the Cossack generals,
have undertaken a final attempt to destroy the cause of peace, wrest
the power from the hands of the soldiers and workmen and the land from
the peasants, and to compel soldiers, sailors, and Cossacks to shed
their blood for the benefit of the Russian and Allied imperialists.</p>

<p>"General Kaledine on the Don and General Dutov in the Ural province
have raised the flag of revolt. The Constitutional Democratic party is
supplying the necessary means to enable them to carry on the fight
against the people. The Rodziankos, the Miliukovs, the Gutchkovs and
the Konovalovs seek to regain <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>(p. 167)</span> power, and, with the aid of the
Kaledines, the Kornilovs, and the Dutovs are endeavoring to turn the
Cossack laborers into an instrument for achieving their criminal aims.</p>

<p>"General Kaledine has declared a state of war in the Don region, is
hindering the supply of bread to the front, and collecting his forces.
General Kornilov, who fled from prison, has arrived at his
side&mdash;Kornilov who in July introduced the death penalty and conducted
a campaign against the revolutionary power in Petrograd. In Orenburg
General Dutov has arrested the executive and the military
revolutionary committee, has disarmed the soldiers and is endeavoring
to capture Tcheliabinsk, in order to cut off the supply of bread from
Siberia to the front and the towns.... The bourgeois Central Committee
of the Ukrainian Republic, which is waging a struggle against the
Ukrainian Workmen's and Soldiers' Councils, is assisting General
Kaledine in drawing troops to the Don region and is hindering the
Workmen's and Soldiers' Councils from distributing the necessary
military forces throughout the Ukraine for the suppression of the
Kaledine rebellion.</p>

<p>"The Constitutional Democrats, the worst enemies of the people, who,
together with the capitalists of all countries, prepared the present
world war, are hoping that as members of the Constituent Assembly they
may be able to come to the assistance of their generals, the
Kaledines, the Kornilovs, and the Dutovs, in order to strangle the
people with their aid."</p>

<p>The document then concluded with a decree declaring a state of siege
in the Ural and Don regions, outlawing leaders of the rebellion, etc.</p>

<p>In typical Russian revolutionary fashion, the fighting, which now took
place between the forces of the Cossack generals and the soldiers of
the Soviets, seems to have been largely limited to mutual threats of
arrest and general argument. The Cossack leaders retired and the
Bolsheviki did not pursue them. One report stated that Kaledine had
been wounded.</p>

<p>For some time the Rumanians had been very busy issuing official
proclamations from their temporary capital, Jassy, denouncing the
peace negotiations and declaring their intention <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span> of fighting
the Central Powers, "to the last man." But in spite of the admiration
these proclamations aroused, there was little hope that the small
Balkan country could actually continue the struggle if Russia made
peace. On December 7, 1917, the Rumanians consented to associate
themselves with Russia in the proposed armistice. The Ukrainian Rada,
also, agreed to a suspension of hostilities, by a vote of 29 to 8. On
the Caucasus front, where the Russians were opposed by the Turks, it
was the latter who took the initiative.</p>

<p>On December 11, 1917, the Constituent Assembly, on which the
conservative elements had based so much hope, attempted to meet in
Petrograd. But of the more than 600 delegates who had been elected
only about fifty were present.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the negotiations for an armistice continued. The original
deputation from Petrograd was now joined, on the side of the Russians,
by delegations from the other fronts farther south, representing the
Ukrainians and the Rumanians. The two points that created discussion
and disagreement were the demands of the Russians that all movements
of troops by the Germans from their eastern fronts should be suspended
during negotiations and the right of the Russians to carry on
unlimited fraternization with the German and Austrian soldiers. The
Teutons were especially disinclined to allow the former; it was
obvious that they wanted to reenforce the Italian and the western
fronts with the soldiers they had to spare on the Russian fronts. But
finally an agreement was reached, on December 16, 1917, and an
armistice was signed by the two sides involved, the armistice to begin
on noon, December 17, 1917, and last for four weeks, until January 14,
1918.</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>(p. 169)</span> CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="title">LEGISLATION BY DECREES</p>


<p>So far, as already recorded, the Constituent Assembly had proved a
fiasco; it could not gather together a quorum. Therefore the
Lenine-Trotzky Cabinet really represented all the authority there was.
Nor did they hesitate to exercise this power to promulgate certain
laws which were in accordance with their program, or principles.</p>

<p>One of the first of these which they proclaimed, on November 26, 1917,
was the abolition of all class titles, distinctions, or privileges;
like the French revolution, every individual was resolved into the
simple "citizen," whatever his position. The corporate properties of
the nobles, large merchants and other "capitalists" were confiscated
by the state.</p>

<p>On December 17, 1917, a similar decree was proclaimed against the
church. This institution in Russia, it must be admitted, had played a
sinister part in Russian politics in the earlier days of the czars and
had been, if that were possible, more reactionary and despotic than
the military or civil authorities. Now, according to the decree, the
properties of the church, in land, money, and other treasure, was
completely confiscated and its jurisdiction over the schools was
ended.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most radical decree was that which was promulgated on
December 16, 1917, in regard to army organization.</p>

<p>Henceforward all officers were to be elected by their men, and those
which were not reelected automatically were degraded to the rank of
privates, with corresponding pay. Nor did such officers have the
relief of resignation, for, having become privates, they were now
subject to the penalties for desertion during war time. In a sense
this was only a natural reaction, for nowhere, perhaps not even in
Germany, were the caste lines drawn so sharply between officers and
private. In the days of the autocracy no soldier could hope to become
an officer, for it was the law that officers must be of noble birth;
they must be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>(p. 170)</span> members of the aristocratic families. The
natural result was that the common soldier was regarded as a degraded
creature and his officers treated him as such. Now came the
opportunity for revenge, and the reports of correspondents seem to
indicate that this was taken full advantage of. Colonels exchanged
places with their orderlies; captains and majors were forced to clean
out the stables. And in not a few cases violence and lynch law were
applied to officers who had been, in former days, hard taskmakers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, throughout the passing days, there were continuous reports
of passive resistance against the authority of the new government. It
was especially among the employees of the administrative departments
of the Government machinery that this resistance arose in the form of
strikes. The officials of the state banks especially proved
recalcitrant and refused to surrender Government moneys. Parties of
drunken soldiers also created disorders, it was reported, breaking
into wine shops and helping themselves to the merchandise. But when
all these minor events are viewed in the retrospect of a month or two,
summed up, it is remarkable how little disorder there really has been
in Petrograd, comparatively speaking. Conditions certainly in no way
approached those existing in France, or Paris, during the French
Revolution.</p>

<p>It was in the Ukraine, not yet in the hands of the Bolsheviki, that
disorder reigned, though they were, apparently, responsible for it in
that they made efforts to gain control. In Odessa, during a few days
around December 16, 1917, something very closely approaching a violent
revolution broke out. Here the Rada had apparently established the
capital of the republic. The Bolshevist element among the troops made
a determined attack on the arsenal, where the Rada was in session. The
officials of the Rada summoned loyal troops by telephone and a pitched
battle ensued in the streets. Then the sailors from the Black Sea were
summoned, but on arriving on the scene part of them went over to the
Bolsheviki. The fighting spread from the arsenal, where the loyal
troops had taken up a strong position, the Bolsheviki getting
possession of the Municipal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>(p. 171)</span> Theater, close at hand. Here some
fierce hand-to-hand encounters took place, the theater building
changing hands several times. Finally the Bolsheviki gained full
possession of the water front, the shipping district, whereupon this
section of the city was bombarded by the loyal artillery. The final
outcome of the fighting was not reported, but apparently the
Bolsheviki were suppressed, for the time being.</p>

<p>But this did not immediately concern the Petrograd Government. Under
the direct supervision of Lenine and Trotzky vast quantities of
Socialist literature were being published in German for the purpose of
distribution along the front. Of one pamphlet it was said that a
hundred thousand copies were carried to the German lines and
distributed in one day. Special newspapers, printed in German, were
issued for the sole purpose of propaganda among the German soldiers.
According to the account of a prominent Belgian Socialist, who visited
Russia, hoping as many Socialists had in other countries of the world
that their principles were to receive a fair trial in the new Russia,
the Bolshevik propaganda in German was hardly calculated to make
converts among intelligent people, for it was written in schoolboy
language, with trivial arguments. Meantime, German propaganda in
Russia was couched in irreproachable Russian and calculated to appeal
to the educated and the unlettered alike.</p>

<p>At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, on December 23, 1917, the peace
negotiations were resumed at Brest-Litovsk. The meeting was attended
by the following delegates:</p>

<p>Germany&mdash;Dr. Richard von Kühlmann, Foreign Minister; Herr von
Rosenberg, Baron von Hock, General Hoffmann, and Major Brinckmann.
Austria-Hungary&mdash;Count Czernin, Foreign Minister; Herr von Merey,
Freiherr von Wisser, Count Colleredo, Count Osaky, Field Marshal von
Chisceries, Lieutenant Polarny, and Major von Gluise.
Bulgaria&mdash;Minister Popov, Former Secretary Kossev, Postmaster General
Stoyanovitch, Colonel Gantchev, and Dr. Anastasov. Turkey&mdash;Former
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nessimy Bey, Ambassador Hakki, Under
Foreign Secretary Hekmit Bey, and General Zekki Pasha.
Russia&mdash;Citizens Jaffe, Kaminev, Bisenko, Pokrosky, Karaghan,
Lubinski, Weltman <span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>(p. 172)</span> Pawlowitch, Admiral Altvater, General
Tumorri, Colonel Rokki, Colonel Zelpett, and Captain Lipsky.</p>

<p>Prince Leopold of Bavaria, as commander in chief of the German forces
in the east, welcomed the delegates and invited Hakki Pasha, as the
senior delegate, to open the conference. Hakki Pasha, after a speech,
declared the conference formally open and proposed Dr. von Kühlmann as
president. The German Foreign Minister was thereupon elected to the
chair unanimously. In his opening speech he said:</p>

<p>"The purpose of this memorable meeting is to end the war between the
Central Powers and Russia and reestablish a state of peace and
friendship. In view of the situation it will be impossible in the
course of these deliberations to prepare an instrument of peace
elaborated in its smallest details. What I have in mind is to fix the
most important principles and conditions on which peaceful and
neighborly intercourse, especially in the cultural and economic sense,
can be speedily resumed, and also to decide upon the best means to
healing the wounds caused by the war.</p>

<p>"Our negotiations will be guided by the spirit of peaceable humanity
and mutual esteem. They must take into account, on the one hand, what
has become historical, in order that we may not lose our footing on
the firm ground of facts, but, on the other hand, they must be
inspired by the new and great leading motive which has brought us here
together.</p>

<p>"It is an auspicious circumstance that the negotiations open within
the sight of that festival which, for centuries past, has promised
peace on earth and good will to men. I enter upon the negotiations
with the desire that our work may make speedy and prosperous
progress."</p>

<p>Having concluded his address, Dr. von Kühlmann proposed the following
rules, which were adopted:</p>

<p>Questions of precedence will be decided according to the alphabetical
list of the represented powers.</p>

<p>Plenary sittings will be presided over by the chief representative of
each of the five powers in rotation.</p>

<p>The following languages may be used in debate: German, Bulgarian,
Turkish, and Russian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>(p. 173)</span> Questions interesting only part of the represented powers may
be discussed separately.</p>

<p>Official reports of the proceedings will be drafted jointly.</p>

<p>At the President's invitation the Russian delegates now presented, in
a long speech, the basic proposals for peace terms, already familiar
in the forms of the various resolutions passed by the Workmen's and
Soldiers' Delegates.</p>

<p>The Russian demands comprised fifteen paragraphs, or points, as
follows:</p>

<p>1. Evacuation of all Russian territory now occupied by Germany, with
autonomy for Poland and the Lithuanian and Lettish provinces.</p>

<p>2. Autonomy for Turkish Armenia.</p>

<p>3. Settlement of the Alsace-Lorraine problem by a free plebiscite.</p>

<p>4. The restoration of Belgium and indemnity through an international
fund for damages.</p>

<p>5. Restoration of Serbia and Montenegro with a similar indemnity,
Serbia gaining access to the Adriatic. Complete autonomy for Bosnia
and Herzegovina.</p>

<p>6. Other contested Balkan territory to be temporarily autonomous
pending plebiscites.</p>

<p>7. Restoration of Rumanian territory with autonomy for the Dobrudja;
the Berlin convention concerning equality for Jews to be put into full
force.</p>

<p>8. Autonomy for the Italian population of Trent and Trieste, pending a
plebiscite.</p>

<p>9. Restoration of the German colonies.</p>

<p>10. Restoration of Persia and Greece.</p>

<p>11. Neutralization of all maritime straits leading to inland seas,
including the Suez and Panama Canals.</p>

<p>12. All belligerents to renounce indemnities; contributions exacted
during the war to be refunded.</p>

<p>13. All belligerents to renounce commercial boycotts after the war or
the institution of special customs agreements.</p>

<p>14. Peace conditions to be settled at a congress composed of delegates
chosen by a national representative body, the condition <span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>(p. 174)</span> being
stipulated by the respective parliaments that the diplomats shall sign
no secret treaty; all such secret treaties to be declared null and
void.</p>

<p>15. Gradual disarmament on land and sea and the establishment of
militia to replace the standing armies.</p>

<p>At almost precisely the same moment that this conference was in
session Trotzky was publicly delivering an address to the members of
the Executive Committee of the Soviet, in Petrograd, in the following
terms:</p>

<p>"We have called you here to ask your support. You must help us in our
efforts to make peace with nations, and not with German militarism. If
our delegation meets, eye to eye, representatives of the German
emperor, without the people, then peace will be impossible. If dead
silence should continue in Europe, if the German emperor should be
enabled to offer offensive terms of peace, we should fight against it.
I do not know to what extent we could fight, because of economic
conditions, utter exhaustion, and the disorganized state of the army.
But I think we would fight. We would release all elderly soldiers and
call the youth of the country to fight to the last drop of their
blood. The Allies must understand that we did not overthrow czarism to
bend our knees before the kaiser. They know our game is not yet ended.</p>

<p>"If they should offer unacceptable terms directed against our basic
principles, then we shall submit the question to the Constituent
Assembly. But our party takes its position for a holy war against
militarism in all countries. But if, exhausted as we are by this
unprecedented slaughter, we must accept the terms of the German
emperor, we would accept them only in order to rise together with the
German people against German militarism, as we did against czarism."</p>

<p>Meanwhile during Christmas the peace conference was proceeding, the
representatives of the Central Powers deliberating over the Russian
proposals.</p>

<p>The German Socialist leaders, Haase, Ledebour, and Kautsky, had
attempted to procure passports that they might go to Stockholm, there
to meet representatives of the Russian Bolsheviki, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175"></a>(p. 175)</span> to learn
at first hand what conditions the latter demanded. But passports were
refused them. Trotzky, hearing of this, telegraphed to the Russian
delegates at Brest-Litovsk, stating that if this refusal were
persisted in, the popular indignation in Petrograd would rise to such
a pitch as to seriously hamper the prospects of success of the
negotiations. Nevertheless, the passports were not granted.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day the Central Powers made their reply to the Russian
peace proposals, and that reply was one which immediately attracted
world-wide attention, for it took in all the Entente Powers.</p>

<p>Through Count Czernin the Central Powers offered a general peace based
on the Russian demands; no annexations, no indemnities, etc. According
to their interpretation, however, the question of the subjection of
nationalities who have not independence, to another country, must not
come under the scope of "self-determination"; such questions must be
decided by each government and its people according to the
constitution of each government.</p>

<p>In the event of mutual renunciation of claims for indemnities for war
costs and war damages, Count Czernin continued, each belligerent would
have to bear only the expense incurred by its subjects made prisoners,
and to pay for damage caused in its territory to property of civilian
subjects of an enemy country by violations of international law. The
creation of a special fund for this purpose, as suggested by the
Russians, could be discussed only in the event that the other
belligerents joined in the peace negotiations within a certain time.</p>

<p>The chairman of the Russian delegation, Jaffe, while expressing his
pleasure at the acceptance of the Russian basic proposals, demurred
over the vagueness of the definition of self-determination of small
nationalities; it was incomplete. He said that the war could not end
without the reestablishment of the violated rights of small and
oppressed nationalities, and Russia would insist on guaranties that
their lawful rights would be protected in a general peace treaty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>(p. 176)</span> "By renouncing the application of the right of the stronger
nations with regard to territories occupied during the war," he
continued, "the Central Powers at the same time give all their
opponents an immediate peace ground. They affirm that the right of the
stronger, after unprecedented bloodshed, shall be preserved with all
its integrity within each of the countries with no regard for little
and oppressed nationalities. The war cannot end without the violated
rights of those nationalities being reestablished. The Russian
delegation insists that those nationalities must in the very next
peace treaty establishing a general peace among all nationalities
receive, on the basis of international agreement, guaranties that
their lawful rights shall be protected. The lapse of time in no case
legalizes the violation of one people by another."</p>

<p>Germany also demanded the return of her overseas colonies, contending
that the valor with which the natives of those colonies had fought for
the German flag testified to their loyalty. While apparently not
strongly impressed with this manifestation of loyalty, the Russians
agreed that Germany had the right to make this demand. The Russian
chairman then proposed that the next session of the conference be
postponed until January 8, 1918, to allow ample time for the
circulation of the German proposals among the Entente nations. At the
end of that time the negotiations should be resumed, whether the
Entente nations responded or not.</p>

<p>The terms of Germany, as submitted in detail to Petrograd several
days later, were substantially as follows:</p>

<p>Article 1.&mdash;Russia and Germany are to declare the state of war at an
end. Both nations are resolved to live together in the future in peace
and friendship on conditions of complete reciprocity. Germany will be
ready, as soon as peace is concluded with Russia, and the
demobilization of the Russian armies has been completed, to evacuate
her present positions in occupied Russian territory, in so far as no
different inferences result from Article 2.</p>

<p>Article 2.&mdash;The Russian Government having, in accordance with its
principles, proclaimed for all peoples, without exception, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>(p. 177)</span>
living within the Russian Empire the right of self-determination,
including complete separation, takes cognizance of the decisions
expressing the will of people demanding a full state of independence
and separation from the Russian Empire for Poland, Lithuania,
Courland, and portions of Esthonia and Livonia, the Russian Government
recognizes that in the present circumstances these manifestations must
be regarded as an expression of the will of the people, and is ready
to draw conclusions therefrom. As in those districts to which the
foregoing stipulations apply, the question of evacuation is not such
as provided for in Article 1, a special commission shall discuss and
fix the time and other details in conformity and in accordance with
the Russian idea of the necessary ratification by a plebiscite on
broad lines and without any military pressure whatever of the already
existing proclamation of separation.</p>

<p>Article 3.&mdash;Treaties and agreements in force before the war are to
become effective if not directly in conflict with changes resulting
from the war. Each party obligates itself, within three months after
the signing of the peace treaty, to inform the other which of the
treaties and agreements will not again become effective.</p>

<p>Article 4.&mdash;Each of the contracting parties will not discriminate
against the subjects, merchant ships, or goods of the other parties.</p>

<p>Article 5.&mdash;The parties agree that with the conclusion of peace
economic war shall cease. During the time necessary for the
restoration of relations there may be limitations upon trade, but the
regulations as to imports are not to be of a too burdensome extent and
high taxes or duties on imports shall not be levied. For the
interchange of goods an organization shall be effected of mixed
commissions, to be formed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Article 6.&mdash;Instead of the commercial treaty of navigation of
1894-1904, which is abrogated, a new treaty will accord new
conditions.</p>

<p>Article 7.&mdash;The parties will grant one another during at least twenty
years the rights of the most favored nations in questions of commerce
and navigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>(p. 178)</span> Article 8.&mdash;Russia agrees that the administration of the
mouth of the Danube be intrusted to a European Danube commission, with
a membership from the countries bordering upon the Danube and the
Black Sea. Above Braila the administration is to be in the hands of
the countries bordering on the Danube.</p>

<p>Article 9.&mdash;Military laws limiting the rights of Germans in Russia, or
Russians in Germany, are to be abrogated.</p>

<p>Article 10.&mdash;The contracting parties are not to demand payment of war
expenditures, nor for damages suffered during the war, this provision
including requisitions.</p>

<p>Article 11.&mdash;Each party is to pay for damage done within its own
limits during the war by acts against international law with regard to
the subjects of other parties, in particular, their diplomatic and
consular representatives, as affecting their life, health, or
property. The amount is to be fixed by mixed commissions with neutral
chairmen.</p>

<p>Article 12.&mdash;Prisoners of war who are invalids are to be immediately
repatriated. The exchange of other prisoners is to be made as soon as
possible, the time to be fixed by a Russian-German commission.</p>

<p>Article 13.&mdash;Civilian subjects, interned or exiled, are to be
immediately released and sent home without cost to them.</p>

<p>Article 14.&mdash;Russian subjects, of German descent, particularly German
colonists, may within ten years emigrate to Germany, with the right to
liquidate or transfer their property.</p>

<p>Article 15.&mdash;Merchantmen of any of the contracting parties, which were
in the ports of any of the other parties at the beginning of the war,
and also vessels taken as prizes which have not yet been adjudged, are
to be returned, or, if that be impossible, paid for.</p>

<p>Article 16.&mdash;Diplomatic and consular relations are to be resumed as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>When these terms were read in Petrograd, the strongest indignation
prevailed; it was Article 2 especially which the Russians were
unwilling to accept.</p>

<p>The Russians had indeed emphasized the right of small nationalities to
determine their own fates, even to separate from Russia, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>(p. 179)</span> if
so they desired. They also recognized their right to join any other
national organization, if they chose.</p>

<p>Of this stand the Germans took full advantage, in rather a clumsy way.
Germany insisted that those certain nationalities specified, Poland,
Esthonia, Livonia, Lithuania, and the others, having declared their
separation from Russia, could, and undoubtedly would, now declare
themselves a part of the German Empire. At any rate, this was to be
assumed.</p>

<p>The Germans had also explained, through General Hoffmann, that Germany
would not evacuate Riga, Libau, and other occupied points until
certain that all Russia sanctioned peace.</p>

<p>Germany's imperialistic schemes in the direction of Russia were very
plainly revealed. Trotsky vaunted it as a signal success for his
so-called diplomacy that he had forced Germany to make manifest her
real purposes. But it was only in Russia that people hoped for any
other attitude on the part of the Central Powers, with Russia's
military power destroyed. Naturally, the peace offer made by Germany
to the Allies was rejected with derision; or, at least, no official
reply was made to it. But it did inspire a speech by President Wilson,
on January 8, 1918, in which the war aims of the United States were
definitely stated and the Russian peace deputation was given credit
for at least the unmasking of German hypocrisy.</p>

<p>It was not until January 2, 1918, that the Russian Government made
known its rejection of the German counterproposals for peace. This
was done through a resolution passed by the Executive Committee of the
Soviet, which was worded as follows:</p>

<p>"This assembly confirms the fact that the program proclaimed by the
representatives of the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk recognizes in
principle the conclusion of a peace without annexations or
indemnities. This recognition establishes the basis for further
pourparlers, with the view of a general democratic peace.</p>

<p>"However, already in this declaration the representatives of the
German Government have refused to admit the free right <span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>(p. 180)</span> of
oppressed nations and colonies seized before the beginning of the war
in 1914 to dispose of their own destinies. This restriction, which was
immediately reported by the Russian delegation, signifies that the
dominant parties in Germany, compelled by a popular movement to grant
concessions to the principle of a democratic peace, nevertheless are
trying to distort this idea in the sense of their own annexationist
policy.</p>

<p>"The Austro-German delegation, in setting forth the practical
conditions of peace in the East, alters still further its idea of a
just democratic peace. This declaration is made in view of the fact
that the Austrian and German Governments refused to guarantee
immediately and irrevocably the removal of their troops from the
occupied countries of Poland, Lithuania, and Courland and parts of
Livonia and Esthonia.</p>

<p>"In fact, the free affirmation of their will by the people of Poland,
Lithuania, Courland, and all other countries occupied by the troops of
other states is impossible until the moment of the return of the
native population to the places they have evacuated. The allegation of
the German delegation that the will of the people of the said
countries has already been manifested is devoid of all foundation.</p>

<p>"Under martial law and under the yoke of the censorship the peoples of
the occupied countries could not express their will. The documents on
which the German Government could base its allegation at best only
prove the manifestation of the will of a few privileged groups, and
in no way the will of the masses in those territories.</p>

<p>"We now declare that the Russian revolution remains faithful to the
policy of internationalism. We defend the right of Poland, Lithuania,
and Courland to dispose of their own destinies actually and freely.
Never will we recognize the justice of imposing the will of a foreign
nation on any other nation whatsoever.</p>

<p>"This joint session insists that the peace pourparlers communicated
later to the neutral states and instructs the Soldiers' and Workmen's
Councils and the Commissioners to take measures to bring this about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>(p. 181)</span> "We say to the people of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria,
and Turkey:</p>

<p>"Under your pressure your Governments have been obliged to accept the
motto of no annexations and no indemnities, but recently they have
been trying to carry on their old policy of evasion. Remember, that
the conclusion of an immediate democratic peace will depend actually
and above all on you. All the people of Europe look to you, exhausted
and bled by such a war as there never was before, that you will not
permit the Austro-German imperialists to make war against
revolutionary Russia for the subjection of Poland, Lithuania,
Courland, and Armenia."</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the issue of this declaration a pamphlet in German
was prepared and published by the hundred thousand copies, wherein the
trickery of the German peace parleys was set forth and their
pretensions denounced as "unconscionable lies." After a description of
the wholesale recruiting of labor forces from Poland and Lithuania
carried on by the Germans, amounting to over 300,000 noncombatants,
the pamphlet continued:</p>

<p>"The German Government only found support in Courland from the hated
slave owners, the German barons, who have their prototypes in the
Polish landowners."</p>

<p>The document further declared that the Germans only desired to free
the peoples of those border countries that they might be exploited as
laborers by German capital, impose an Austrian monarchy in Poland and
make Lithuania and Courland German provinces. "On such a basis,"
added the pamphlet, "we shall never continue negotiations."</p>

<p>The Russian people themselves did not understand the manner in which
they had been tricked and betrayed by Trotzky and Lenine and hoped
much from the distribution of quantities of these pamphlets among
German and Austrian soldiers. Indeed, the German and Austrian
commanders are said to have endeavored to have this literature
confiscated and destroyed, though it seemed to have little effect on
the soldiers of their armies.</p>

<p>On the same date that the official rejection of the German proposals
was issued, January 2, 1918, the chairman of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>(p. 182)</span> Russian
peace delegation sent an official telegram to the German, Austrian,
Turkish, and Bulgarian delegations stating that the Russian Government
desired to continue the negotiations on foreign soil, in a neutral
country, and therefore suggested that the next conference be held in
Stockholm. A revision of Articles 1 and 2 of the German-Austrian terms
must be discussed, these messages added.</p>

<p>The next session of the peace conference was held at Brest-Litovsk, on
January 10, 1918. Trotzky himself now attended, as head of the Russian
delegation, to assume direct charge of the deliberations. The
Ukrainians were now, for the first time, represented by an independent
deputation, their independence being recognized by both the Russians
and the representatives of the Central Powers. Bolubovitch, the head
of the Ukrainian delegation, said that he had been instructed to hand
the following note to the members of the conference:</p>

<p>"The Ukrainian Republic brings the following to the knowledge of all
belligerents and neutral states: The Central Rada, on November 20,
1917, proclaimed a People's Republic, and by this act acquired an
international status. It has as its ideal the creation of a
confederation of all the republics which have arisen in the territory
of the former Russian Empire. The Ukrainian People's Republic, through
its General Secretariat, proceeds to enter into independent relations
pending the formation of a Federal Government in Russia."</p>

<p>The head of the Ukrainian deputation further added that Ukrainia also
desired that the peace to be established be on a general democratic
basis, in which the rights of the smallest nationalities be
recognized.</p>

<p>At the session held on January 11, 1918, it was agreed to prolong the
period of the armistice another month, until February 12. A German
report dated January 14, 1918, stated that a subcommittee of
Austrians, Germans, and Russians had held three sittings in order to
arrange territorial adjustments. The one point of difference on which
no agreement could be reached was the border provinces. These the
Germans were obviously determined to hold, and here was the deadlock.
On January 21, 1918, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>(p. 183)</span> the conference adjourned, the Russian
delegates refusing to accept the Teutonic proposals, yet willing to
meet again within a week's time.</p>

<p>At Petrograd Trotzky delivered his report and made his recommendations
before a Congress of the Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, on January
28, 1918, the day before returning to Brest-Litovsk to resume
negotiations. He pretended opposition to accepting the German
proposals, and the sentiment of the delegates supported him. Already
Krylenko had been calling for volunteers to form a Russian army of
"Red Guards" to carry on a "holy war" against the imperialism of the
Central Powers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during the last two weeks of January, 1918, other important
events had taken place, the most notable of which was the final
dissolution of the Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p>This famous body was scheduled to hold its first meeting on January
18, 1918, about 500 delegates being now assembled in Petrograd, to
judge from the voting. The Bolsheviki had almost a majority; they
were, at any rate, the leading element, but they now contended that
the delegates had been elected on issues now dead, or at least that
the candidates had not yet been able to declare themselves before the
election.</p>

<p>Tchernov, the former Minister of Agriculture in the Kerensky Cabinet,
was elected chairman at the first session, by a vote of 244 against
151. Several others of Kerensky's old supporters, now in prison, were
allowed to attend under guard. The first day's session was marked by
considerable disorder, in the midst of which the Bolshevist members
withdrew in a body.</p>

<p>On the following day the Executive Committee of the Soldiers' and
Workmen's Council issued a decree dissolving the Constituent Assembly,
which order was accordingly enforced by the necessary display of armed
force. The explanation of the reason for this action was, as usual,
couched in the phraseology of ultra-Socialism, but in this instance
was absolutely unconvincing, even from the Socialist point of view.</p>

<p>During the latter part of January, 1918, the relations between
Petrograd and Finland became extremely unpleasant. As far back as
December 5, 1917, Finland had declared itself independent, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>(p. 184)</span>
and according to their principles, this declaration the Bolsheviki had
acknowledged. But, as it was also the case in Ukrainia, there was a
very strong Bolshevist element in Finland, which immediately
precipitated a state of civil warfare against the conservative
elements. The Baltic fleet, being in the hands of the Bolsheviki,
naturally gave its support to the Finnish Bolsheviki, who were enabled
to establish themselves in the capital, Helsingfors. The Conservatives
immediately protested to other nations, including even Germany, that
though Russia had recognized Finnish independence, she was still
interfering in domestic affairs, and that with armed force. A call for
active armed assistance was also made on Sweden, and at the end of the
month Sweden seemed inclined to respond.</p>

<p>Similar trouble was experienced with Rumania, except that the
Petrograd Government stood in a reversed position; the Rumanians were
taking aggressive action against the Bolsheviki along the southern
front. Rumania, whose military effort had been checkmated, not so much
by the Teutons as by the treachery of pro-German Russian officials,
distrusted the Bolsheviki and entered Bessarabia. The Bolshevist
Russians in Bessarabia resisted this action, whereupon the Rumanians
shot them. The Petrograd Government took immediate action; it arrested
the Rumanian ambassador in Petrograd, Constantine Diamandi, and
together with his staff threw them in prison, on January 14, 1918.
Against this rather irregular procedure the whole diplomatic body in
Petrograd protested to Lenine, and two days later Diamandi was
released. On that same day, however, an ultimatum was sent to Rumania,
demanding the release of certain Russians whom the Rumanians were
holding. On January 20, 1918, the Russian forces, established at the
southern extremity of the front, at Galatz, were cut off from
communication with Russia, then attacked by the Rumanians. A pitched
battle ensued, with the result that the Russians, much inferior in
number, were hemmed in. On the 26th Rumanian troops attacked and
captured Kishinev, the chief city in Bessarabia. In these maneuvers
Rumania had the active assistance of General Dimitri Tcherbatchev,
commanding a section of the adjacent <span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>(p. 185)</span> front. On January 28,
1918, the Petrograd Government broke off relations with Rumania and
declared General Tcherbatchev "an outlaw and an enemy of the revolution
and of the Russian people." The Rumanian gold reserves, deposited in
Moscow and amounting to 1,200,000,000 rubles, were seized, "to be
returned to the Rumanian people when they shall assert their
authority."</p>

<p>But in Ukrainia, during this same period, the Bolshevist elements were
making rapid headway. On the same day that Rumania occupied Kishinev,
the Black Sea fleet definitely swung over to the Bolsheviki and seized
the Rumanian transport ships and other shipping belonging to the
Rumanian Government, consisting of about forty steamers and several
old warships. Then cooperating with the Bolshevist land forces, the
city of Odessa was attacked, and on the last day of the month not only
this city, but Kiev as well, were reported to be in the hands of the
Bolshevist Soviets, thus placing them in control of affairs in
Ukrainia.</p>

<p>Among the Cossacks of the Don region the partisans of the Soviets
were also said to be gaining in general support. Here, too, a republic
had declared itself, with Kaledine as president. One report had it
that he had resigned on account of his unpopularity with his own men.
At any rate, he had shown no further aggressive activity against the
Petrograd Government; as the hoped-for regenerator of Russia he proved
a decided failure.</p>

<p>On the first day of February, 1918, the peace parleys were again in
session at Brest-Litovsk, with Trotzky at the head of the Russian
deputation, strengthened now by the Bolshevist deputation from
Ukrainia.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>(p. 186)</span> PART IV&mdash;ITALIAN FRONT</h2>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="title">THE CAPTURE OF MONTE SANTO</p>


<p>During the first three weeks of August, 1917, little of importance
happened on the Italian front. The comparative inactivity which had
prevailed during most of July, 1917, continued, interrupted only
occasionally by local engagements of no particular moment at various
points in the different sectors of the entire front. There were plenty
of rumors, though, concerning preparations that were being made on the
Italian side for a resumption of activities, and on August 19, 1917,
the first definite reports were received to the effect that the
Italians had begun a new and powerful offensive movement in the Julian
Alps along a front of some thirty-five miles.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that their successes in 1916, which gained for
them Goritz, had left them still without possession of the heights,
rising from 1,800 to 2,200 feet to the northeast and east of that town
and had brought them to the edge of the mountains to the west of the
Carso Plateau. In a twenty-five days' campaign, begun May 14, 1917,
they had then improved this position by crossing the Isonzo to the
north of Goritz, by capturing Monte Cucco on its east bank and by
extending their positions along this bank so as to include the Vodice
Ridge, bringing them right up against the slopes of Monte Santo. On
the Carso, too, they had succeeded in advancing so that their
artillery could reach the heights west of it, including the Hermada
Hills.</p>

<p>Their line then, as constituted in August, 1917, began some miles
southwest of Tolmino, ran for a little more than five <span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>(p. 187)</span> miles
along the west bank of the Isonzo, crossed it west of the village of
Decla, ran along the east bank for about five more miles, then
opposite a bend in the river turned south for about another five miles
to the San Marco, running at a distance of about one and one-half
miles east of Goritz, and then twisted in a general southern direction
for some fifteen miles, crossing in its course the valley of the
Vippacco River, down to the Gulf of Trieste where it ended about two
miles southeast of Monfalcone.</p>

<p>It appears that in the new drive, now started, there were engaged: The
Third Army, under General Cappello, in the north, on the Bainsizza
Plateau, Monte Santo, Monte San Gabriele, and the approaches to San
Daniele; the Second Army, under the Duke of Aosta, operating south to
the sea, in the valleys of Vippacco and Brestovizza, on the Carso, and
before Hermada; British and Italian monitors, which bombarded Hermada
and the Austrian ships and arsenals at Trieste and Pola; the great
Caproni aerial machines, which both on the battle line and over
Trieste and Pola aided the work of the soldiers and warships.</p>

<p>Not until August 19, 1917, did it become known that for many weeks
prior to the beginning of the offensive the Italians at sundown every
night had by a great engineering feat diverted the water of the Isonzo
above Anhovo, and had built in the shallow stream thus left 10-foot
bridges, which were concealed from view when the water resumed its
natural course each morning. On the eve of the crossing they
supplemented these with four pontoon bridges laid while their
searchlights blinded the eyes of the Austrians on the opposite cliffs.
These bridges extended from Anhovo up to Loga, a distance of four
miles. That night, August 18, 1917, the stream remained diverted and
the army of Cappello crossed, while the Duke of Aosta performed a
diversion on the Carso.</p>

<p>In the morning of August 19, 1917, after a twenty-four hours'
bombardment, during which Italian artillery shelled the Austrian
positions with ever-increasing intensity, the masses of Italian
infantry commenced the advance toward their objectives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>(p. 188)</span> From Plava, between Anhovo and Goritz, as far as the sea,
after having crossed the Austrian first line, which was completely
destroyed, Italian troops brought pressure to bear upon the Austrians,
who, resisting strongly and being supported by considerable artillery
and a large number of machine guns, offered a desperate resistance.</p>

<p>Altogether 208 Italian aeroplanes participated in the battle,
attacking repeatedly with bombs and machine guns the troops assembled
to the rear of Austrian positions.</p>

<p>The enemy's losses were very serious. The booty, even during the first
day, was very considerable. Some guns and a large number of machine
guns were taken by the Italians and more than 7,500 men and about 100
officers had passed into Italian collecting stations by the end of the
first evening.</p>

<p>During the next few days severe fighting continued. By the evening of
August 20, 1917, the number of Austrians taken by the Italians had
increased to over 10,000 men and about 250 officers.</p>

<p>On the night of August 19-20, 1917, the Austrians attempted a
diversion by concentrating fire and carrying out local attacks at
various points on the Trentino and Carnia fronts. They were everywhere
repulsed. One of their storming parties was destroyed in the Lagarina
Valley, and another which had succeeded in gaining a foothold in one
of the Italian advance posts southeast of Monte Maio was driven back
by a prompt counterattack.</p>

<p>During August 19, 1917, cooperating with the advance of the army,
floating batteries of the Italian navy and British and Italian
monitors effectively bombarded the Austrian positions and
communications on the lower Isonzo. Simultaneously Italian monitors
were bombarding the Austrian dockyards south of Trieste. Austrian
batteries replied vigorously, but the Allies' units were entirely
unharmed. At nightfall they were attacked unsuccessfully by Austrian
aeroplanes. One of these was brought down by antiaircraft guns and
captured in the Grado Lagoon, mouth of the Isonzo.</p>

<p>During the continuation of the fighting in the northern part of the
line, the Austrian lines on the Carso Plateau and on the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>(p. 189)</span>
coastal zone began to bend and give way at various points. Italian
forces succeeded in carrying the well-organized Austrian defenses
between Korite and Selo, near the strongly fortified position of Stari
Lokva.</p>

<p>During the night of August 24, 1917, the Austrians evacuated Monte
Santo, which, soon afterward, was occupied by Italian forces.</p>

<p>By August 25, 1917, the number of prisoners taken amounted to more
than 600 officers and 23,000 men. The number of guns captured had
risen to seventy-five, including two 305-millimeter, (twelve inches)
mortars and many guns of medium caliber.</p>

<p>On August 26, 1917, on the Bainsizza Plateau, northeast of Goritz, the
intensity of the struggle increased. With extreme desperation and a
greater employment of forces, the Austrians sought to prevent the
Italians from progressing toward the eastern edge of the plateau.</p>

<p>Not only did the Austrian resistance stiffen considerably, but the
Italians also had to overcome great natural difficulties.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the first part of their advance after the
crossing of the Isonzo was a climb of 2,000 feet, and that the upland
of Bainsizza is not flat but traversed by ridges which rise to a
considerable height above the general level. One peak, for instance,
northeast of Na Kobil, is over 3,100 feet above the sea, and the range
that runs farther to the north along the eastern rim of the plateau
above the upper Chiapovano Valley reaches a height of over 3,500 feet.</p>

<p>In spite of these conditions, however, fighting continued on the
Bainsizza Plateau. After having overcome the Austrian rear guards,
Italian troops on August 28, 1917, encountered a powerful line of
resistance which had been previously organized and which the Austrians
were defending with desperation. On the heights beyond Goritz the
Italians made some gains. During the day they captured more than 1,000
prisoners and several machine guns. Altogether 247 airplanes
participated in the battle.</p>

<p>A squadron of forty Caproni machines, which took part in the action
east of Goritz, dropped many tons of projectiles on Austrian batteries
in the Panovizza Wood.</p>

<p class="smcap">The Italian advance in Istria.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>(p. 191)</span> On the Carso only an artillery duel and patrol action
occurred.</p>

<p>In the Stelvio region, on the Trentino front, the Austrians attacked
one of the Italian advanced posts on the glaciers in the upper Zebru
Valley and succeeded in penetrating it. The Italian forces, however,
were able to occupy a higher summit, from which they kept their old
position under fire.</p>

<p>The next day, August 29, 1917, the Austrians attempted on the
Bainsizza Plateau and east of Goritz, by counterattacking in force, to
retake positions recently captured. They were driven back everywhere.
The Italian lines held firmly, and advanced at some points.</p>

<p>Italian aircraft successfully renewed bombardment of Austrian
batteries in Panovizza Wood, on the Carso. An Austrian attack between
Vippacco and Dosso Faiti broke down.</p>

<p>On the Trentino front, from Stelvio to Carnia, concentrated fire and
numerous reconnoitering actions kept the Austrians busy. In the Tofane
region the Austrians, after intense artillery preparation, attacked
the Italian positions at the mouth of the Travenanzes Valley three
times and with great violence, but were repulsed.</p>

<p>All this time the most determined struggle was going on for the
possession of Monte San Gabriele, which changed hands a number of
times. Both on August 30 and 31, 1917, very brisk fighting occurred on
the northern slopes of Monte San Gabriele and east of Goritz, where
the Austrians with repeated violent counterattacks attempted to drive
back the Italians. They were repulsed with heavy losses. On the Carso,
in the Brestovizza Valley, the Italians carried other elements of
trenches.</p>

<p>The total number of prisoners taken from the beginning of the Italian
offensive to the end of August, 1917, had risen to 720 officers and
26,582 men.</p>

<p>Trieste, too, was continuously a point of attraction to the Italians.
Hardly a day passed without an attack being made on it by Italian
airmen.</p>

<p>Throughout the next few days the fighting continued without abatement.
Again Monte San Gabriele was the center of it. Following the Italian
success of August 30, 1917, the Austrians <span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>(p. 192)</span> had attempted a
number of times to regain their positions there. But the Italians held
on and continued their preparations for further attacks. The final
storming of this important and desperately contested position was
described by the London "Times" correspondent, attached to Italian
headquarters, in part as follows:</p>

<p>"The attack came on the morning of September 3, 1917, when the
Italians went forward in three columns. One column attacked straight
along the crest, one worked along the northeastern slope, while the
third advanced on the right, where the first precipitous fall of the
ridge meets the steep slope that comes up from Salcano past the
jutting spurs of Hill 343 and Santa Caterina. The left-hand column was
held up southeast of Hill 552 by a rocky bastion that juts out
eastward from the main massif, but it kept the Austrians in this
sector very busy and diverted their attention from the flank and
center columns. The right-hand column got well forward and performed
the same service for the other flank of the main attack, which was
brilliantly successful.</p>

<p>"Nothing could stop the center column, which was made up of volunteer
storming troops. These broke down all resistance. They stormed the
machine-gun positions, careless of loss, and reached the caverns,
where the Austrian reserves were caught like rats. In less than an
hour the Italians were in possession of the main peak.</p>

<p>"They had thrust a wedge into the enemy position on the mountain, but
their own position was precarious. The enemy still lay round them
east, south, southwest, on the lower grounds, indeed, but for that
very reason they were half protected from the terrific hail of shells
that had pounded the crest to fragments.</p>

<p>"Altogether the center column took nearly 1,500 prisoners&mdash;more than
the whole number of the 'forlorn hope' that had stormed the peak.
Think of what they had done. They had rushed a steep glacis that rises
about 300 feet in 600 yards, a glacis not more than 200 or 300 yards
wide. At the end of the last abrupt rise they had stormed trenches cut
in the rock and full of machine guns."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>(p. 193)</span> The day following the capture of Monte San Gabriele,
September 4, 1917, the battle on the Julian front was violently
renewed. On the Bainsizza Plateau the Italians obtained new
advantages, capturing an important position southwest of Corogio.</p>

<p>On the Carso Plateau the Austrians, after most violent bombardment,
launched infantry forces against the Italian positions from
Castagnevizza to the sea. On the northern section of the line, between
Castagnevizza and Korite, the attack, after varying fortunes, was
repulsed. In the center, between Korite and Celle, the Italian troops
resisted seven furious assaults and maintained their positions.</p>

<p>To the south, between the Brestovizza Valley and the sea, the
Austrians were able to gain an initial success between Hill 146, to
the northeast of Flondar and the railway tunnel northeast of Lokavac,
where the Italians were compelled to withdraw temporarily from a few
advanced positions. In the afternoon, by energetic counterattacks, the
Italian line was reestablished, with the capture of 402 prisoners,
including fourteen officers.</p>

<p>Two hundred and sixty-one Italian airplanes participated in the
battle, bombing the Austrian troops and their communication lines.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="title">THE STRUGGLE ON THE ISONZO FRONT</p>


<p>Immense quantities of booty had been captured by this time by the
Italians as a result of their successful offensive movement. On the
Bainsizza Plateau, near Santo Spirito and Laska, whole convoys of arms
and munitions were abandoned by the Austrians in such haste that there
was no time to destroy them. At one point thousands of boxes of
projectiles, hand grenades, rockets, shoes, rifles, and helmets were
strewn everywhere.</p>

<p>Mule paths and the adjacent side hills were littered with unexploded
projectiles which the Austrians had thrown away, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>(p. 194)</span> together
with daggers, swords, and iron-studded maces used for dispatching the
wounded. On Hill 652 the Italians captured three 105-millimeter
cannon. Two of them were perfectly serviceable, and the Italians
turned them on their former owners.</p>

<p>In an armored dugout near Ravena the Italians discovered the entire
equipment of an Austrian staff of brigade. The extraordinary variety
of objects found testified to the haste of the retreat. It included
electric lights, official documents, toilet articles, kitchen
utensils, ventilators, and even love letters. Ravena was the Austrian
center of supplies for engineer troops, and near by were found stores
of picks, shovels, hoes and wire cutters, entire outfits of electric
equipments, miles of steel rails, and innumerable rolls of barbed
wire.</p>

<p>During the next few days the fighting was chiefly done by the
artillery on both the Bainsizza and the Carso Plateaus. The Austrians
attempted a number of counterattacks, all of which, however, fell
short of the desired results. During the period, devoted by the
Italians to the consolidation of the newly conquered territory, they
found time to count their prisoners and to list their booty. The
result was the announcement that during the actual offensive there had
been captured 30,671 Austrians, including 858 officers, and that the
Austrians also had lost: 145 guns, including about eighty of medium
caliber, ninety-four trench mortars and bomb throwers, 322 machine
guns, 11,196 rifles.</p>

<p>Besides their attempts at counterattacking the Austrians also tried to
relieve the Italian pressure on the Isonzo front, by launching a
number of local attacks on some of the other fronts. In no case,
however, were they successful. Thus on September 7, 1917, in the
Concei Valley, west of Lake Garda, local attacks against two Italian
advanced posts were repulsed.</p>

<p>Again on September 9, 1917, on the Trentino front Austrian
reconnoitering parties were put to flight by Italian advanced posts in
Cima di Cady, Tonale, in the Zurez region, east of Lake Garda and on
Col di Lana. In the Carnia an attack against Italian positions of
Monte Granuda and Cuel Tarond completely <span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>(p. 195)</span> failed, though
carried out in force after careful artillery preparation.</p>

<p>West of Lake Garda the Austrians, after intense artillery preparation,
attacked Italian advanced posts on September 10, 1917, between the
Concei Valley and the Lake of Ledro, succeeding in gaining a foothold
in one of them, but were immediately driven out.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the Timavo, upper end of Gulf of Trieste, Austrian
storming parties, which, with the support of infantry waves, moved
against the Italian positions on the extreme right wing, were stopped
and put to flight with severe losses caused especially by barrage
fire.</p>

<p>The Austrians now began a series of most desperate counterattacks in
the attempt to drive the Italians from Monte San Gabriele which they
had gained after terrific fighting some days ago. Various attacks were
launched on September 11, 1917, against the Italian lines on the
Bainsizza Plateau, afterward concentrating their greatest efforts in
the region northeast of Goritz.</p>

<p>After having kept under most violent fire for several hours the
Italian positions occupied along the crest of Monte San Gabriele, and
on the western slopes of the mountain descending toward Salcano, they
attacked from the east and south. The bitter struggle, which began at
dawn, became more pronounced around the western edge of the table-land
of Santa Caterina. Finally toward midday the Austrians, beaten and
repulsed, gave up their fruitless attempts.</p>

<p>The crest of Monte San Gabriele is distant about one and a half miles
east by north from Salcano, and the western edge of the Santa Caterina
table-land is about half a mile from Salcano, Santa Caterina being
somewhat to the south of a line drawn between Monte San Gabriele and
Salcano. It appears, therefore, that the Italian front must make a
sharp salient at San Gabriele.</p>

<p>On the following day, September 12, 1917, northeast of Goritz, the
Austrians employing units recently sent to the front, renewed with
greater intensity and with a larger number of forces their attempts to
dislodge the Italians from Monte San Gabriele. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>(p. 196)</span> Their furious
attacks were successful in a few advanced posts, but were stopped by
the Italian main line of occupation, which could not be shaken or
penetrated.</p>

<p>On September 13 and 14, 1917, the Italians succeeded in extending
their previous gains on the Bainsizza Plateau. On the former date this
was accomplished near Log, in the northern zone of the plateau, and on
the latter date in the southeastern corner. During the night of
September 15 to 16, 1917, the Austrians attempted, without success, by
four successive counterattacks to regain this ground. Other
counterattacks, made September 16, 1917, were equally unavailing.
During this period there was also considerable artillery and aerial
activity on the other sectors of the Isonzo front.</p>

<p>Local actions of limited extent also occurred on the Trentino front.</p>

<p>On September 15, 1917, greater activity of Austrian artillery provoked
a brisk reaction on the part of the Italian artillery in the Upper But
and Fella Valley in Carnia. On the Carso Plateau, too, there was
considerable artillery action during all these days.</p>

<p>A comparative lull set in during the next week, September 16 to 23,
1917. Though the Austrians had gained some ground on the summit of
Monte San Gabriele, this was of little import, because the position
was so located that neither side could possibly hold it for any length
of time. On the other hand the Italians had captured two more heights
on the Bainsizza Plateau near Volnik, which they succeeded in holding
against repeated Austrian attacks and heavy artillery fire.</p>

<p>In the Marmolada region, on the night of September 21-22, 1917, by
exploding a mine which had been prepared with long tunneling work,
Italian parties were enabled to penetrate two advanced Austrian
positions and to establish themselves there.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of Raccogliano and Selo in the Carso, on the same
day, the Italians succeeded in making a slight advance.</p>

<p>During September 23, 1917, the railway line in the Bazza Valley, east
of Tolmino, was the objective of Italian air forces. In the morning
one of the Italian bombarding squadrons arrived <span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>(p. 197)</span> over the
railway station of Grahovo, about five or six miles eastsoutheast of
Tolmino, at a moment when intense railway movements were going on, and
four tons of bombs were dropped there. In the night an Italian
airship, by dropping numerous high-explosive bombs, greatly damaged
the establishments in the neighborhood of Podmelec, midway between
Tolmino and Grahovo. At the same time another Italian airship once
again bombarded the numerous Austrian troops in the Chiapovano Valley.</p>

<p>In the Monte Nero region, upper Isonzo, the Austrians exploded on
September 24, 1917, a powerful mine under Italian positions, upon
which they then concentrated violent artillery fire. Prompt and
effective barrage fire, hindering the advance of the infantry,
prevented the Austrians from gaining any advantage. The damage done
was slight.</p>

<p>Another let-up set in for the next few days. However, on September 28,
1917, Italian storming troops made a surprise attack toward the
southeastern edge of the Bainsizza Plateau, capturing some of the high
ground south of Podlaka and southeast of Madoni, and forty-nine
officers and 1,360 men. Subsequent violent enemy counterattacks
accompanied by heavy bombardment were repulsed and the positions
maintained.</p>

<p>On the night of September 28-29, 1917, and on the following day, fresh
attempts on the part of the Austrians to dislodge the Italians from
the positions occupied between Sella di Dol and the northern slopes of
Monte San Gabriele failed. On the remainder of the front considerable
artillery activity and numerous good patrol actions were reported.</p>

<p>Air fighting was very brisk along the whole Julian front. Italian air
squadrons bombarded the enemy depots at Berje, northeast of Nabresina,
Gulf of Trieste, and during the night the known military works of the
fortress of Pola with excellent results. The response of the enemy was
vigorous everywhere.</p>

<p>The following day, September 29, 1917, Italian troops, by means of
another successful surprise attack, rectified their line between the
Sella di Dol and the northern slopes of Monte San Gabriele. Eight
officers, 216 men, and a few machine guns were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>(p. 198)</span> captured. The
position was maintained and strengthened, not withstanding that the
Austrians repeatedly counterattacked.</p>

<p>Italian air attacks were concentrated on the military zone of
Voiscizza, Carso, which was effectively bombarded, and on the
fortified maritime center of Pola, where the submarine base and the
arsenal were again bombed with numerous projectiles by a strong
Italian bombardment squadron. During the night Austrian aircraft
dropped incendiary bombs on the town of Palmanova, causing slight
damage, but no casualties. Austrian aircraft also dropped bombs on
Aquileja, Monfalcone, and other localities of the lower Isonzo,
without doing much damage. During September 30, 1917, the Austrians
renewed their attacks against the Italian positions, recently occupied
by them on the Bainsizza Plateau, but were repulsed. On the other hand
the Italians reported that they had taken prisoners, in their
offensive actions during September 28-30, 1917, a total of 2,019
Austrians, including sixty-three officers.</p>

<p>In Val di Fumo, Adamello, Austrian parties attempting to reach Italian
positions between the Passo della Porta and the Forcel Rosso Pass were
repulsed and pursued by Italian patrols, who captured a quantity of
ammunition and explosives.</p>

<p>The first three weeks in October, 1917, passed without any happenings
of much significance. Weather conditions began to become unfavorable
and it looked at this time as if affairs were about to settle down to
the accustomed trench warfare of past winters. Only a few engagements
are worthy of special mentioning.</p>

<p>At dawn of October 2, 1917, the Austrians once more attacked the
Italian positions on the western slopes of Monte San Gabriele. The
attack failed. An assault company was destroyed and the battalion
following it, caught in its turn under the fire of Italian batteries
and attacked by Italian troops, was dispersed. On the remainder of the
Bainsizza Plateau front there were only patrol actions.</p>

<p>Air activity was very lively. During the day one of the Italian
squadrons carried out a bombardment on the railway station of Grahovo,
Bazza Valley, northeast of Goritz. During <span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>(p. 199)</span> the previous night
in two successive raids the military objectives of Pola were bombarded
and damaged.</p>

<p>During the night of October 3-4, 1917, one of the Italian bombarding
squadrons, composed of a large number of machines, flew over the naval
base of Cattaro. The Austrians replied by a violent fire. The Italian
airmen on several occasions, and with visibly good results, hit
torpedo boats and submarines lying in the harbor.</p>

<p>On October 4, 1917, from the Giudicaria, as far as the Brenta, Italian
patrols were operating, and captured some prisoners. Artillery
bombardments were more frequent and more lively on the Asiago Plateau.</p>

<p>In the region of San Gabriele repeated attacks launched by the
Austrians were repulsed. To the east of Goritz the Italians improved a
point in our line by a coup de main, and held it, in spite of violent
Austrian counterattacks. On the Carso intermittent artillery actions
took place as well as attempts to attack on the part of Austrian
patrols, which were repulsed.</p>

<p>Snowstorms and gales now began to prevail in the Trentino, while the
Isonzo and Carso lines were inundated by rain, and the valleys
transformed into lakes of mud. The torrents were so swollen and
impetuous as often to be impassable.</p>

<p>During the night of October 11-12, 1917, in the Costabella region, San
Pellegrino Valley, an attempted Austrian attack was crushed. On the
Julian front Italian patrols effectively harassed Austrian working
parties and brought in some prisoners. Artillery activity was
considerable from the Rombon, upper Isonzo, to the sea.</p>

<p>During the next day, October 13, 1917, there was considerable
artillery activity from the Stelvio to the Rombon, as well as on the
Bainsizza Plateau and on the southern front of the Carso. At Vrhovec,
west of Chiapovano, Austrian parties attempting to approach the
Italian positions were repulsed.</p>

<p>Along the whole Julian front there were lively local actions of the
infantry on October 14, 1916. On the southern slope of Monte Rombon,
north of Piesso, by a successful coup de main the Italians captured
some prisoners. Between Castagnavizza <span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>(p. 200)</span> and Selo, Carso, an
Italian raid brought other prisoners. In the Brestovizza Valley large
Austrian parties, protected by violent artillery and machine-gun fire,
approached the Italian lines, but were driven back. Near Lokavac,
southeast of Monfalcone, after a lavish artillery preparation
extending from the west of Flondar to the sea, an Austrian attack was
broken up.</p>

<p>Throughout October 15, 1917, on the Trentino front there was moderate
activity. North of Lenzumo, Lake Ledro, in an encounter of advanced
posts, Austrian patrols were driven back. On the Carso and Julian
fronts, from the Paralba, Carnia, to the Rombon, upper Isonzo, there
was desultory artillery fighting, on the Bainsizza Plateau intense
artillery duels, on the front lines and on the lines of communication
of the Carso the usual destructive and harassing fire.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="title">THE AUSTRO-GERMAN OFFENSIVE IN ITALY</p>


<p>In the preceding chapters we have been told of the Italian successes
gained in the summer of 1917 and the spasmodic fighting following
them. The latter was frequently interrupted by periods of comparative
quiet, and sometimes during the early fall of 1917 very vague rumors
would be heard to the effect that they ought to be interpreted as the
proverbial calm before the storm. However, as time passed and nothing
of any import occurred, it began to look as if the Central Powers had
decided to maintain the positions they occupied during the winter.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that the last fighting of any extent took place
about October 15, 1917. This was followed by about a week of
comparative quiet. Suddenly on October 21, 1917, reports came from
Rome that Italian observers had noticed the removal of troops from the
Trentino and Carso fronts to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>(p. 201)</span> Bainsizza Plateau, as well
as the arrival of fresh contingents from the Russian front, where
evidently the Germans apparently expected no further serious
developments. Usually activity was also reported in the Austrian
trenches.</p>

<p>On the preceding day, October 20, 1917, notwithstanding adverse
atmospheric conditions on the Trentino front, brisk engagements with
rifle fire took place here and there. Northeast of Laghi Pesinar
Austrian parties were driven back and counterattacked by Italian
patrols. In the Booche region in the Pellegrino Valley Austrian
parties came in contact with the garrisons of the Italian advanced
posts, but after a fierce struggle they were forced to withdraw to
their positions. On the Julian front the Austrian artillery showed
spasmodic activity. Italian batteries replied with well-directed
bursts of fire and effective concentration.</p>

<p>The air continued to be full of rumors. On October 23, 1917, it was
semiofficially reported that "General Cadorna is making preparations
on an extensive scale for an important military movement, but that
there could not be any disclosure, for military reasons, of the
objective, extent, or character of the movement or when the Italian
offensive will be resumed."</p>

<p>Another report had it "that British and French soldiers, guns,
munitions were being sent by train to the Italian front."</p>

<p>Still another bit of gossip was that reports of an impending Austrian
offensive had proved to be unfounded and that "General Cadorna
desired to start a new offensive against Austria and as a consequence
there had been an extreme enlivenment of trench, mortar, and artillery
firing from the Tolmino to the southern Carso and over the entire area
of the Bainsizza Plateau, which was still in progress. Although the
firing was uninterrupted on the part of the Italians, it was declared
not to be the prelude of a fresh attack."</p>

<p>The reports covering events at the front during the preceding day,
October 22, 1917, showed that the Italian positions on Monte Piana, in
the Cadore, were strongly attacked by Austro-German forces. After
heavy fighting the enemy was driven back with severe loss. On the
following morning, October 23, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>(p. 202)</span> 1917, Italian storming parties
recaptured a portion of their intrenchments which the Austrians had
temporarily occupied.</p>

<p>On the remainder of the front there were lively local engagements. In
the Cordevole Valley and at the head of the Padola Valley the Italians
repulsed enemy detachments.</p>

<p>On the Julian front the artillery action continued intense the whole
day. The weather conditions were favorable also to aerial activity.</p>

<p>From then on events as reported from the front made it clearer and
clearer day by day that the Austrians, supported by strong German
reenforcements, were about to launch an important offensive movement,
the extent of which, of course, at that time could not be predicted.
By October 23, 1917, the fighting activity had been perceptibly
revived in the Tyrolean, Carnia, and Isonzo regions. German artillery
took part in the artillery battle, and German and Austro-Hungarian
infantrymen captured the foremost Italian positions near Flitsch and
Tolmino and in the northern portion of the Bainsizza Plateau, taking
some thousands of prisoners.</p>

<p>On October 24, 1917, after an interval of a few hours, the Austrians
resumed the violent bombardment all along the front, with a specially
destructive fire on that portion between the southern slopes of Monte
Rombon and the northern edge of the Bainsizza Plateau, where afterward
a strong infantry attack was launched. The Narrows of Saga resisted
the hostile blow; but farther south, favored by a thick mist which
rendered useless the Italian barrage fire, the Austrians succeeded in
breaking through the Italian lines on the left bank of the Isonzo.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the bridgehead of Santa Maria and Santa Lucia,
they then brought the battle on to the slopes of the right bank of the
river.</p>

<p>At the same time, powerful attacks were made to the west of Volnik, on
the Bainsizza Plateau, and on the western slopes of Monte San
Gabriele, but they were kept in check by the Italian troops, which in
the course of successful counterattacks captured a few hundred
prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>(p. 203)</span> On the Carso, a violent Austrian bombardment was effectively
countered by Italian batteries. The Germans claimed that up to the end
of the day more than 10,000 prisoners, including divisional and
brigade staffs, and rich booty in guns and war material had been
taken.</p>

<p>The offensive against the Italian left wing on the Julian front
continued during the night and on October 25, 1917, conducted by
powerful forces. From Montemaggiore to the west of Auzza the Italians
were forced to withdraw to their boundary line, in consequence of
which they had to provide for the evacuation of the Bainsizza Plateau.
East of Goritz and on the Carso the situation remained unchanged.</p>

<p>This meant that the Germans, profiting by their success in breaking
through the line near Flitsch and Tolmino, were advancing beyond
Caporetto and Ronzina. They were already fighting at many places on
Italian territory. The number of prisoners had increased to more than
30,000, of whom 700 were officers. The booty amounted to more than 300
guns, including many heavy ones.</p>

<p>The Austro-German offensive now began to gain more and more momentum
almost every hour. It became known that Von Mackensen was in supreme
command of the forces of the Central Powers. Favored by good weather,
the German and Austro-Hungarian divisions pressed forward irresistibly
over heights and through the valleys. The steep mountain ridge of Stol
was captured and soon afterward the strongly fortified summit of
Monte Matajur, 1,641 meters high, fell.</p>

<p>The Germans claimed that by now the number of prisoners had increased
to 60,000 and the captured guns to 450 and that inestimable quantities
of war materials were yet to be salved from the captured Italian
positions.</p>

<p>After having crossed the boundary line between Monte Canin and the
head of the Judrio Valley, the Austrians, by October 26, 1917, were
attempting to reach an opening on the plains. On the Carso their
effort was increasing. Strong offensive thrusts, however, were
repulsed by the Italian troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>(p. 204)</span> The worst fears now began to be realized and with stunning
swiftness the Austro-German forces forced back the Italians from
territory which the latter had gained only by fighting most valiantly
for months. In spite of determined resistance, which only in some
instances was not all that might have reasonably been expected, the
Italian forces were thrown back by powerful thrusts. In the evening of
October 27, 1917, German troops forced their way into the burning town
of Cividale, the first town in point of position in the plain. The
Italian front as far as the Adriatic Sea was now wavering. The
Austro-German troops were pressing forward on the whole line. Goritz,
the much-disputed town in the Isonzo battles, was taken early on
October 28, 1917, by Austro-Hungarian Divisions.</p>

<p>Cividale is a town of about 5,000 inhabitants, nine miles northeast of
the important railroad center of Udine. It is near the entrance to the
valley of the Natisone River, along which the Austro-German forces
which broke the Italian line in the Tolmino region battered their way.
Cividale is in the foothills of the Julian Alps, beyond which lie the
plains of northern Italy.</p>

<p>Goritz was captured by the Italians on August 9, 1916. It is a town of
31,000 inhabitants on the Isonzo, halfway down the river from Tolmino
to the sea. It is strongly situated among hills of great defensive
value, in which there was heavy fighting before the Italians reached
the city itself. Goritz is twenty-two miles northwest of Trieste,
Austria's big seaport at the head of the Adriatic, the capture of
which is one of the principal Italian aspirations in the war.</p>

<p>By October 28, 1917, the defeated second Italian army was retreating
toward the Tagliamento. The third Italian army, it was claimed,
offered only brief resistance to the attack against their positions
from Wippach to the sea and hastily retreated along the Adriatic
coast. North of the broad sector which had been pierced, the Italian
front also was now yielding as far as the Ploecken Pass.</p>

<p class="smcap">Different stages of the Italian retreat.</p>
</div>

<p>Italian rear guards vainly endeavored to stem the advance of the
armies of the Central Powers. Austro-Hungarian troops were then
standing before Udine, hitherto the grand <span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>(p. 206)</span> Italian
headquarters. Other Austro-Hungarian divisions captured Cormons, and
were approaching the frontier in the coastal region.</p>

<p>All roads were covered with retreating columns and cars belonging to
the Italian army and to the Italian population, who, overcome by the
sudden disaster to their armies, were fleeing in a pathetic disorder,
matched only by the flight of the Belgian civilians in the early part
of the war.</p>

<p>The number of prisoners and the quantity of booty was reported as
continually increasing. Violent tempests and heavy rains prevailed on
the vast fighting area of the twelfth Isonzo battle, but seemed to
have no influence on the furious onslaughts of the invading hordes.</p>

<p>On October 29, 1917, the fall of Udine was announced. It is sixty
miles northeast of Venice, ten miles east of the frontier, sixteen
miles west of the new Tagliamento line, and only 300 feet above sea
level. It is situated on the Roia Canal, a branch of the Torre River.
It is a quaint and prosperous town, chiefly interested in the
manufacture of hemp, flax, and cotton goods, is the capital of the
province, the seat of an archbishop, and has a population of 25,000.
In the present war Udine had been the general headquarters of the
second and third Italian armies. Five railways radiate from Udine west
to link up with the Venetian-Quadrilateral system, by which the second
and third armies have been supplied; north, across the frontier, to
link up with the Vienna-Trentino line; northeast only as far as
Cividale, whence the town was invested; southeast, via Goritz to
Trieste; and due south, over the lower plains to a small steam
tramway which skirts the marshes.</p>

<p>The officer responding to salutes is the Italian
commander in chief, General Diaz, who succeeded General Cadorna in
November, 1917. Next beside him is the French General Fayolle.</p>
</div>

<p>By then, too, the Italian Carnia front seemed to have collapsed on the
most important sectors. During a snowstorm Austrian troops wrested
from the Italians frontier positions which they had built up during
two and a half years southwest of Tarvis, near Pontafel, in the
Ploecken region, and on St. Pal. Advancing out of the Carnic Alps the
invaders set foot on Venetian soil along the entire front, and were
pressing forward against the upper course of the Tagliamento, even
though the Italians <span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span> destroyed, wherever possible, bridges
and other means of communication in order to delay the hostile
advance.</p>

<p>In spite of valiant efforts on the part of the Italians to stem the
tide of invaders, the latter gained new successes on the last day of
October, 1917. Portions of the Italian army made a stand at the
Tagliamento. Austro-Hungarian forces, however, stormed the last
Tagliamento bridgehead, near Latisana, on the lower reaches of the
river, south of Codroipo. The bridgehead positions at the latter place
and at Dignano were taken by storm by German troops. The Germans
claimed that as a result of these operations more than 60,000
Italians, cut off and outflanked on both sides, laid down their arms,
and that the number of prisoners taken by them had increased to more
than 180,000 and that the number of guns captured had increased to
more than 1,500. Late that day such Italian forces as were still
maintaining themselves on the eastern bank of the Tagliamento near
Pinzano and Latisana were either driven back or taken prisoners. In
less than a week's fighting the troops of the Central Powers had
pushed forward a thirty-mile front an average distance of thirty
miles, making the total of the territory wrested from the Italians
some 1,000 square miles.</p>

<p>On November 1, 1917, it was reported that Anglo-French reenforcements
had reached the Italian front. Of course, these were comparatively
small in number and were sent more for the moral effect their arrival
would have than for any actual military value. The battle continued
without let-up. Along the middle and lower Tagliamento the opposing
armies were in continuous fighting contact. By evening the left bank
of the river had been cleared of Italians from the Fella Valley to the
Adriatic Sea. That the Italian armies were not totally annihilated was
due solely to the efficient rear-guard actions which parts of them had
fought against terrific odds.</p>

<p>During November 2 and 3, 1917, the fighting along the Tagliamento was
chiefly done by the artillery of both armies. The Germans again
claimed large increases in the number of prisoners and guns captured.
On the other hand the Italians claimed that a great many of the
200,000 so-called prisoners <span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>(p. 208)</span> were mainly workmen or other
units of a noncombatant nature and that of the "more than 1,800 guns"
the majority were machine guns.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="title">THE ITALIANS AT BAY ON THE PIAVE</p>


<p>Ever since Udine had fallen into the hands of the Central Powers,
there had, of course, been much speculation as to what the real German
objective was and how and where the Italians were finally going to
make a stand against the Austro-German onslaught. For some time it
seemed as if the Central Powers were going to try to capture Venice
and as if the Italians were going to attempt to prevent it by making a
stand at the Tagliamento River. When, however, the fighting along that
river, as described in the latter part of the last chapter, gradually
but definitely went against the Italians, it soon became clear that
the Tagliamento line could not be held for any length of time.</p>

<p>This assumption was proved to be correct very soon. On November 4,
1917, German and Austro-Hungarian divisions succeeded in crossing the
middle course of the river and immediately began to press the
advantage gained. General Cadorna's line now was broken again and a
continued resistance in its present position had become too dangerous
to be feasible. It was, therefore, not much of a surprise when news
came that the Italians had begun a new retreat on November 5, 1917,
especially in view of the fact that Austro-German pressure in the
northern, mountainous section of the line had also become so strong
that it resulted in evacuation of territory on the part of the
Italians.</p>

<p>However, the few days' resistance offered on the Tagliamento had
served its purpose. It enabled the Italians to rearrange their
shattered armies to a certain extent, so that their withdrawal had
been changed from a rout to an orderly retreat. It was made in the
direction of the Livenza River, some fifteen <span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>(p. 209)</span> miles west of
the Tagliamento. The Livenza, however, did not offer the necessary
natural defenses to make a determined and extended defense possible,
and its only purpose was to delay the enemy sufficiently long to make
it possible for the Italians to withdraw in good order behind the next
line of defense, the Piave. The Livenza line was reached on November
6, 1917. But so close were the Austro-Germans that the Italians
immediately proceeded to cross the Livenza. Indeed, by November 7,
1917, some Austro-German forces, too, had forced their way across the
river at some points.</p>

<p>In spite of this, however, the Italians succeeded in extricating
themselves from their dangerous position and in withdrawing the great
bulk of their forces behind the next line of defense, the Piave River.
There it had been determined to face the foe. The Italians, it is
true, continued to lose a considerable number of men as prisoners. But
compared with their losses of the two preceding weeks, the present
losses were slight and showed a decided revival of the Italian
resistance and a slowing up of the Austro-German advance.</p>

<p>It also became known now that General Cadorna, who had been in command
of the Italian armies since the beginning of the war, had been
relieved of this command and had been appointed as the chief military
representative of Italy on the permanent interallied military
committee. His successor in chief command of the Italian armies was
General Diaz, and under him were to be Generals Badoglio and Giardino.
The new commander in chief was fifty-six years old, eleven years the
junior of General Cadorna. At the outbreak of the war, in 1914, he was
a colonel. The second in command was only forty-six years old and had
risen since the beginning of the war to his present rank from that of
a major of artillery.</p>

<p>By November 9, 1917, the Italians had reached their more or less
prepared positions on the lower Piave and frantically began digging
themselves in. In the north, however, matters did not go well with the
Italians. Austro-Hungarian troops succeeded in pressing forward in the
Sugana Valley and in the upper Piave valley. After desperate fighting
in the streets <span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>(p. 210)</span> Asiago was captured by them. This town is some
twenty miles west of the Piave and only a few miles across the
Austro-Italian border. On the lower Piave the Italians crossed to the
west bank, blowing up behind them all bridges and established
themselves fairly firm behind the river from Susegana, in the
foothills of the Alps, to the Adriatic, a line of some forty miles.</p>

<p>The Austrians extended their gains in the north on November 10, 1917.
Belluno, on the upper Piave, was taken by them, and so was Vidor and
its bridgehead, some twenty-five miles downstream, not, however, until
the bridge itself had been blown up by the Italians. Fighting on the
lower Piave was restricted to artillery and machine-gun firing.</p>

<p>As a result of their gains in the Belluno sector, the Austro-Germans
claimed on November 12, 1917, to have captured about 14,000 prisoners
and numerous guns and to have reached Feltre, a small town at a bend
of the middle Piave.</p>

<p>Heavy fighting occurred on November 12, 1917, on the Asiago plateau.
But the Italian line, established there from Monte
Gallio-Longara-Meletta di Gallio, held. Between the Brenta and the
Piave the Austro-Germans occupied territory previously evacuated by
the Italians and reached contact with the Italian lines. On the lower
Piave the Italian line held, except at one point, about twelve miles
northwest of the mouth of the Piave. There, near Monte San Dona di
Piave, about twenty-three miles northeast of Venice, enemy groups
succeeded, with the aid of large boats, in crossing to the west bank
of the Piave. Italian counterattacks, however, promptly drove them
back and the Italian lines were reestablished without a break.</p>

<p>On November 13, 1917, the Central Powers again registered successes.
They took Primolano on the upper Brenta and Feltre on the middle
Piave. Near the Adriatic they crossed the lower Piave and gained a
slight foothold on its western bank, which, however, they were unable
to extend in width in spite of determined efforts. A surprise attack
against the Italian rear from the north in the region of Lake Garda
failed.</p>

<p>New attempts on the part of the Austro-German forces to cross the
lower Piave, made repeatedly during November 14, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>(p. 211)</span> 1917, were
promptly repulsed by the Italians, whose power of resistance gradually
seemed to stiffen. The same fate met renewed Teuton attacks along the
entire front from Asiago to the Piave River, attempted on November 15,
1917. In this the Italians were assisted by opening the floodgates of
the Piave River.</p>

<p>The following day, November 16, 1917, the forces of the Central Powers
succeeded at two points in crossing the Piave, but were unable to
maintain their gains against the fierce counterattacks of the
Italians, though they captured Prassolan.</p>

<p>Again on November 17, 1917, the enemy attempted to get across the
Piave. Everywhere however, the Italian line held like a wall of steel.
Between the Brenta and the Piave the Austro-Germans were even forced
to withdraw slightly.</p>

<p>The heaviest kind of fighting raged for the next four weeks in the
Alps between Asiago and the Piave. From day to day the fortune of
battle wavered. With admirable tenacity the Italians held every
position to the very limit of their power and gave up only against
overpowering strength, giving way occasionally almost foot by foot,
only to come back with strong counterattacks as soon as they regained
their breath. The difficulties under which this fighting was done
beggars description. For not only were there the natural difficulties
of the mountainous terrain, comparatively bare of means of
communication, except the wonderful Italian mountain roads, but it
must also be remembered that winter had set in long ago and that snow
and gales added their share of hardships.</p>

<p>To recite in detail this tremendous struggle would cover page after
page and, in a way, would involve much repetition. The complete story
would read more like an ancient epic poem than the description of a
modern battle. We must be satisfied with an outline of events as they
happened day by day.</p>

<p>On November 18, 1917, the Austro-Germans captured Quero, a little town
on the Piave, south of Feltre, Monte Cornelle and Monte Tomba. Four
times they tried to storm Mt. Monfenera on the 19th, and four times
the Italians drove them back. The following day, November 20, 1917,
they were no more successful in their attacks against Monte Pertica,
and again on November <span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>(p. 212)</span> 21, 1917, they failed in their
attempts, both against Monte Pertica and Monte Monfenera. However, on
that day they succeeded in wresting from the Italians Monte Fontana
Secca and Monte Spinoucia, farther to the north and east.</p>

<p>An encircling movement against Monte Meletta, northeast of Asiago,
attempted by the Austrians on November 22, 1917, was thwarted by the
Italians and numerous attacks against various points between the
Brenta and Piave Rivers also failed.</p>

<p>The Italians did not restrict themselves to defending their positions.
Whenever the chance offered they undertook offensive movements and as
a result of one of these they recaptured, on November 23, 1917, both
Monte Tomba and Monte Pertica. They also made some slight gains in the
region of Monte Meletta during November 24, 1917. Between that date
and December 3, 1917, the Austro-Germans made many attacks along the
entire Asiago-Quero front. None of them succeeded in gaining their
objectives.</p>

<p>On December 4 and 5, 1917, the Italians were driven from strong
positions which they held between Monte Tondarecar and Monte
Badenecche, some miles east of Monte Meletta. But when the enemy
attempted to extend his operations still farther west he was checked.
However, as a result of his success, he was able, on December 6, 1917,
to take Monte Sisemol, farther south. Still farther south the Italian
line held in spite of repeated attempts to break it.</p>

<p>For the next few days the fighting in the hills slowed down
considerably. But on December 11, 1917, the Austro-Germans again began
to pound away against the Italian positions. Attacks were launched
that day against Col di Beretta and Col dell'Orso, and once more Monte
Spinoucia was stormed. Three days later, December 14, 1917, Col
Caprille, just southwest of Col di Beretta, was reached by the
Austrians.</p>

<p>In the latter part or December, 1917, we hear from time to time of
separate actions of the English and French forces which had been
rushed to the assistance of the Italian armies. Thus an English attack
was launched on December 16, 1917, against Monte Fontana Secca, but
failed to accomplish the desired result. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>(p. 213)</span> The French,
supported by British and Italian artillery and airplanes, were more
successful on December 30, 1917, when they took by storm some
important positions on Monte Tomba.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Italians had continued their struggle to keep the
Austro-Hungarians from breaking into the plains from the north, with
varying success. On December 18, 1917, they lost their positions on
Monte Asolone, south of Col Caprille. Strong counterattacks during
December 20 and 21, 1917, promptly regained them. On December 23,
1917, the Teutons made some gains near Monte Valbella, and on the
following day they took the hills as well as Col de Rosso. On December
25, 1917, the Italians recaptured both, but eventually had to give
them up again and permit the enemy to pass even slightly farther
toward the south.</p>

<p>During the first two weeks of January, 1918, the Italians at all times
held their lines in the Asiago sector. On January 14 and 15, 1918,
they registered some gains in the region of Monte Asolone. On January
23, 1918, the Austro-Germans were forced to evacuate positions in the
Monte Tomba region and to move back to Monte Spinoucia. During the
last week of January, 1918, the Italians succeeded in pushing back the
enemy at many points between the Piave and Asiago and thus establish
beyond all doubt that, for the time being at least, the way into the
Italian plains was closed to the invaders from the north.</p>

<p>Things had been going even better for the Italians on the lower Piave,
between November 15, 1917, and January 31, 1918. Some isolated
attempts of the Austro-Germans to gain the west bank, it is true, were
successful. But at no time did these successes last. Almost as soon as
a position had been taken by them, the Italians threw themselves
against it and drove the invaders back to the east bank. From all
sides thus Venice and the Italian plains were held safely against all
Austro-German attacks at the end of January, 1918, and confidence
regained by the Italians through their success in stopping the
Teutonic onslaught promised that the future, too, would keep the
balance of Italy free from the enemy, if not, indeed, he should be
thrown back once more beyond his own frontier.</p>

AFRICA</h2>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="title">THE PALESTINE CAMPAIGN</p>


<p>In midsummer, 1917, it will be remembered, a change had been made in
the command of the British forces in Palestine, officially known as
the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, and General Allenby was made
commander in chief.</p>

<p>At that time the Turkish army in southern Palestine held a strong
position extending from the sea at Gaza, roughly along the main
Gaza-Beersheba road to Beersheba. Gaza had been made into a strong
modern fortress, heavily intrenched and wired, offering every facility
for protracted defense. The remainder of the enemy's line consisted of
a series of strong localities, viz.: the Sihan group of works, the
Atawinek group, the Baha group, the Abu Hareira-Arab el Teeaha trench
system, and, finally, the works covering Beersheba. These groups of
works were generally from 1,500 to 2,000 yards apart, except that the
distance from the Hareira group to Beersheba was about four and
one-half miles.</p>

<p>The enemy's force was on a wide front, the distance from Gaza to
Beersheba being about thirty miles; but his lateral communications
were good, and any threatened point of the line could be very quickly
reenforced.</p>

<p>The British forces were extended on a front of twenty-two miles, from
the sea, opposite Gaza, to Gamli.</p>

<p>Owing to lack of water the British were unable, without preparations
which would require some considerable time, to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>(p. 215)</span> approach
within striking distance of the enemy, except in the small sector near
the seacoast opposite Gaza.</p>

<p>According to official reports the British general had decided to
strike the main blow against the left flank of the main Turkish
position, Hareira and Sheria. The capture of Beersheba was a necessary
preliminary to this operation, in order to secure the water supplies
at that place and to give room for the deployment of the attacking
force on the high ground to the north and northwest of Beersheba, from
which direction the British intended to attack the Hareira-Sheria
line.</p>

<p>The difficulties to be overcome in the operations against Beersheba
and the Sheria-Hareira line were considerable, and careful
preparations and training were necessary. The chief difficulties were
those of water and transport, and arrangements had to be made to
insure that the troops could be kept supplied with water while
operating at considerable distances from their original water base for
a period which might amount to a week or more; for, though it was
known that an ample supply of water existed at Beersheba, it was
uncertain how quickly it could be developed or to what extent the
enemy would have damaged the wells before the British succeeded in
occupying the town. Except at Beersheba, no large supply of water
could be found till Sheria and Hareira had been captured.</p>

<p>The transport problem was no less difficult; there were no good roads
south of the line Gaza-Beersheba, and no reliance could therefore be
placed on the use of motor transport. Owing to the steep banks of many
of the wadis which intersected the area of operations, the routes
passable by wheeled transport were limited, and the going was heavy
and difficult in many places. Practically the whole of the transport
available in the British force, including 30,000 pack camels, had to
be allotted to one portion of the eastern force to enable it to be
kept supplied with food, water, and ammunition at a distance of
fifteen to twenty miles in advance of the railhead. Arrangements were
also made for the railhead to be pushed forward as rapidly as possible
toward Karm, and for a line to be laid from Gamli toward Beersheba for
the transport of ammunition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>(p. 216)</span> A railway line was also laid from Deir el Belha to the Wadi
Ghuzze, close behind the sector held by another portion of the eastern
force.</p>

<p>Considerable strain was thrown on the military railway from Kantara to
the front during the period of preparation. In addition to the normal
requirements of the force, a number of siege and heavy batteries,
besides other artillery and units, had to be moved to the front, and
large depots of supplies, ammunition, and other stores accumulated at
the various railheads.</p>

<p>During the period from July to October the Turkish force on the
Palestine front had been increased. It was evident, from the arrival
of these reenforcements and the construction of railway extensions
from El Tine, on the Ramleh-Beersheba railway, to Deir Sincid and Belt
Hanun, north of Gaza, and from Deir Sincid to Huj, and from reports of
the transport of large supplies of ammunition and other stores to the
Palestine front, that the Turks were determined to make every effort
to maintain their position on the Gaza-Beersheba line.</p>

<p>The date of the attack on Beersheba, which was to commence the
operations, was fixed as October 31, 1917.</p>

<p>On the morning of October 27, 1917, the Turks made a strong
reconnoissance toward Karm from the direction of Kauwukah, two
regiments of cavalry and two or three thousand infantry, with guns,
being employed. They attacked a line of British outposts near El
Girheir, covering railway construction. One small post was rushed and
cut up, but not before inflicting heavy loss on the enemy; another
post, though surrounded, held out all day, and also caused the enemy
heavy loss. British reenforcements succeeded in coming up in time, and
on their advance the Turks withdrew.</p>

<p>The bombardment of the Gaza defenses commenced on October 27, 1917,
and on October 30, 1917, warships of the Royal Navy, assisted by a
French battleship, began cooperating in this bombardment.</p>

<p>On the evening of October 30, 1917, the portion of the British eastern
force, which was to make the attack on Beersheba, was concentrated in
positions of readiness for the night march to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>(p. 217)</span> its position of
deployment. The night march to the positions of deployment was
successfully carried out, all units reaching their appointed positions
up to time.</p>

<p>The plan was to attack the Turkish works between the Khalasa road and
the Wadi Saba with two divisions, masking the works north of the Wadi
Saba with the Imperial Camel Corps and some infantry, while a portion
of the 53d (Welsh) Division farther north covered the left of the
corps. The right of the attack was covered by a cavalry regiment.
Farther east, mounted troops took up a line opposite the southern
defenses of Beersheba.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to the main attack, in order to enable field guns to
be brought within effective range for wire cutting, the enemy's
advanced works at 1,070 were to be taken. This was successfully
accomplished in the early morning of October 31, 1917, after a short
preliminary bombardment. By about 1 p. m. the whole of the works
between the Khalasa road and the Wadi Saba were in British hands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the British mounted troops, after a night march, had arrived
early in the morning of October 31, 1917, about Khasim Zanna, in the
hills some five miles east of Beersheba. From the hills the advance
into Beersheba from the east and northeast had to be made over an open
and almost flat plain, commanded by the rising ground north of the
town and flanked by an underfeature in the Wadi Saba called Tel el
Saba.</p>

<p>A British force was sent north to secure Bir es Sakaty, on the Hebron
road, and protect the right flank; this force met with some
opposition, and was engaged with hostile cavalry at Bir es Sakaty and
to the north during the day. Tel el Saba was found strongly held by
the enemy, and was not captured till late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile attempts to advance in small parties across the plain toward
the town had made slow progress. In the evening, however, a mounted
attack by Australian Light Horse, who rode straight at the town from
the east, proved completely successful. They galloped over two deep
trenches held by the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>(p. 218)</span> enemy just outside the town, and entered
the town at about 7 p. m., October 31, 1917.</p>

<p>About 2,000 prisoners and 13 guns were taken, and some 500 Turkish
corpses were buried on the battle field. This success laid open the
left flank of the main Turkish position for a decisive blow.</p>

<p>After the complete success of the Beersheba operations, the attack on
Gaza was ordered to take place on the morning of November 2, 1917.</p>

<p>The objectives of this attack were the works from Umbrella Hill (2,000
yards southwest of the town) to Sheikh Hasan, on the sea (about 2,500
yards northwest of the town). The front of the attack was about 6,000
yards, and Sheikh Hasan, the farthest objective, was over 3,000 yards
from the British front line. The ground over which the attack took
place consisted of sand dunes, rising in places up to 150 feet in
height. This sand is very deep and heavy-going. The Turkish defenses
consisted of several lines of strongly built trenches and redoubts.</p>

<p>Umbrella Hill was attacked and captured during the night of November
1, 1917.</p>

<p>The main attack was successful in reaching all objectives, except for
a section of trench on the left and some of the final objectives in
the center. Four hundred and fifty prisoners were taken and many Turks
killed. The enemy also suffered heavily from the preliminary
bombardment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on the British right flank the water and transport
difficulties were found to be greater than anticipated, and the
preparations for the second phase of the attack were somewhat delayed
in consequence.</p>

<p>However, in the early morning of November 1, 1917, the 63d Division,
with the Imperial Camel Corps on its right, had moved out into the
hills north of Beersheba, with the object of securing the flank of the
attack on Sheria. Mounted troops were also sent north along the Hebron
road to secure Dhaheriyeh.</p>

<p>The 53d Division took up a position from Towall Abu Jerwal (six miles
north of Beersheba) to Muweileh (four miles northeast of Abu Irgeig).
Irish troops occupied Abu Irgeig the same day.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>(p. 220)</span> On November 3, 1917, the British advanced north on Ain Kohleh
and Tel Khuweilfeh, near which place the mounted troops had engaged
considerable enemy forces on the previous day. This advance was
strongly opposed, but was pushed on through difficult hill country to
within a short distance of Ain Kohleh and Khuweilfeh. At these places
the enemy was found holding a strong position with considerable and
increasing forces. During November 4 and 5, 1917, the Turks made
several determined attacks on the British mounted troops. These
attacks were repulsed.</p>

<p>By the evening of November 5, 1917, all preparations had been made to
attack the Kauwukah and Rushdi systems and to make every effort to
reach Sheria before nightfall.</p>

<p>The mounted troops were prepared in the event of a success by the main
force to push north in pursuit of the enemy. Tel el Khuweilfeh was to
be attacked at dawn on November 6, 1917, and the troops were to
endeavor to reach the line Tel el Khuweilfeh-Rijm el Dhib.</p>

<p>At dawn on November 6, 1917, the attacking force had taken up
positions of readiness to the southeast of the Kauwukah system of
trenches.</p>

<p>The attack progressed rapidly and was completely successful in
capturing all its objectives, and the whole of the Rushdi system in
addition. Sheria Station was also captured before dark. The Yeomanry
reached the line of the Wadi Sheria to Wadi Union; and the troops on
the left were close to Hareira Redoubt, which was still occupied by
the enemy. Some 600 prisoners were taken and some guns and machine
guns captured. The British casualties were comparatively slight.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, as soon as it was seen that the attack had
succeeded, mounted troops were ordered to take up the pursuit and to
occupy Huj and Jemmamah.</p>

<p>The 53d Division again did very severe fighting on November 6, 1917.
Their attack at dawn on Tel el Khuweilfeh was successful, and, though
they were driven off a hill by a counterattack, they retook it and
captured another hill, which much improved their position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>(p. 221)</span> The bombardment of Gaza had meanwhile continued, and another
attack was ordered to take place on the night of November 6-7, 1917.</p>

<p>The objectives were, on the right, Outpost Hill and Middlesex Hill,
and on the left the line Bellah Trench-Turtle Hill.</p>

<p>During November 6, 1917, a certain amount of movement on the roads
north of Gaza had been observed by British airmen and fired on by
British heavy artillery.</p>

<p>The attack on Outpost Hill and Middlesex Hill met with little
opposition, and as soon, after they had been taken, as patrols could
be pushed forward, the enemy was found to be gone. Other British
troops on the left also found at dawn that the enemy had retired
during the night, and early in the morning the main British force
occupied the northern and eastern defenses of Gaza. Turkish rear
guards were still occupying Beit Hanun and the Atawineh and Tank
systems, from whence Turkish artillery continued to fire on Gaza and
Ali Muntar till dusk.</p>

<p>As soon as it was seen that the Turks had evacuated Gaza a part of the
British force pushed along the coast to the mouth of the Wadi Hesi, so
as to turn the Wadi Hesi line and prevent the enemy making any stand
there. British cavalry had already pushed on round the north of Gaza,
and became engaged with an enemy rear guard at Beit Hanun, which
maintained its position till nightfall. The force advancing along the
coast reached the Wadi Hesi by evening, and succeeded in establishing
itself on the north bank in the face of considerable opposition, a
Turkish rear guard making several determined counterattacks.</p>

<p>On the extreme right the situation remained practically unchanged
during November 7, 1917; the Turks made no further attempt to
counterattack, but maintained their positions.</p>

<p>In the center the Hareira Tepe Redoubt was captured at dawn. The
London troops, after a severe engagement at Tel el Sheria, which they
captured by a bayonet charge at 4 a. m. on November 7, 1917,
subsequently repulsing several counterattacks, pushed forward their
line about a mile to the north of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>(p. 222)</span> Tel el Sheria; the mounted
troops on the right moved toward Jemmamah and Huj, but met with
considerable opposition from hostile rear guards.</p>

<p>During November 8, 1917, the advance was continued. The Turkish rear
guards fought stubbornly and offered considerable opposition. Near Huj
a British charge captured twelve guns, and broke the resistance of a
hostile rear guard. It soon became obvious that the Turks were
retiring in considerable disorganization.</p>

<p>By November 9, 1917, operations had reached the stage of a direct
pursuit by as many troops as could be supplied.</p>

<p>On the evening of November 9, 1917, there were indications that the
Turks were organizing a counterattack toward Arak el Menshiye by all
available units of the force which had retired toward Hebron, with the
object of taking pressure off the main force, which was retiring along
the coastal plain.</p>

<p>The British, however, decided to press the pursuit and to reach the
Junction Station as early as possible, thus cutting off the Jerusalem
Army, while the Imperial Camel Corps was ordered to move to the
neighborhood of Tel el Nejile, where it would be on the flank of any
counterstroke from the hills.</p>

<p>Operations on November 10 and 11, 1917, showed a stiffening of the
enemy's resistance on the general line of the Wadi Sukereir, with
center about El Kustineh; the Hebron group, after an ineffective
demonstration in the direction of Arak el Menshiye on the 10th,
retired northeast and prolonged the enemy's line toward Beit Jibrin.
Royal Flying Corps reports indicated the total Turkish forces on this
line at about 15,000.</p>

<p>British progress on November 10 and 11, 1917, was slow; the troops
suffered considerably from thirst, as a hot, exhausting wind blew
during these two days.</p>

<p>November 12, 1917, was spent in preparations for the attack on the
enemy's position covering Junction Station. British forces were now
operating at a distance of some thirty-five miles in advance of their
railhead, and the bringing up and distribution of supplies and
ammunition formed a difficult <span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>(p. 223)</span> problem. The routes north of
Wadi Hesi were found to be hard and good going, though there were some
difficult Wadi crossings, but the main road through Gaza and as far as
Beit Hanun was sandy and difficult.</p>


<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="title">THE FALL OF JERUSALEM</p>


<p>On the morning of November 13, 1917, the Turks had strung out their
forces, amounting probably to more than 20,000 rifles, on a front of
twenty miles, from El Kubeibeh on the north to about Beit Jibrin to
the south. The right half of their line ran roughly parallel to and
only about five miles in front of the Ramleh-Junction Station railway,
their main line of supply from the north, and their right flank was
already almost turned.</p>

<p>The advance guard of the 52d Division had forced its way almost to
Burkah on November 11, 1917, on which day also some mounted troops
pushed across the Nahr Sukereir at Jisr Esdud, where they held a
bridgehead. During November 12, 1917, other British forces pushed
north up the left bank of the Nahr Sukereir, and eventually seized
Tel-el-Murreh on the right bank near the mouth.</p>

<p>The Australian mounted troops, extended over a wide front, secured the
British flank and pressed forward on November 12, 1917, toward Balin,
Berkusie, and Tel-es-Safi. Their advance troops were counterattacked
and driven back a short distance, but the Turks made no effort to
press farther forward. The British then decided to attack on November
13, 1917.</p>

<p>The country over which the attack took place is open and rolling,
dotted with small villages surrounded by mud walls with plantations of
trees outside the walls. The most prominent feature is the line of
heights on which are the villages of Katrah and El Mughar, standing
out above the low flat ground which separates them from the rising
ground to the west, on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>(p. 224)</span> which stands the village of Beshit,
about 2,000 yards distant. This Katrah-El Mughar line forms a very
strong position, and it was here that the Turks made their most
determined resistance against the turning movement directed against
their right flank. The 52d Division, assisted by a charge of mounted
troops, who galloped across the plain under heavy fire and turned the
Turkish position from the north, captured the position. Some 1,100
prisoners, three guns, and many machine guns were taken here. After
this the Turkish resistance weakened, and by the evening the Turks
were retiring east and north.</p>

<p>The British infantry, who were sent forward about dusk to occupy
Junction Station, met with some resistance and halted, for the night,
not much more than a mile west of the station. Early next morning
(November 14, 1917) they occupied the station.</p>

<p>The Turkish army had now been broken into two separate parts, which
retired north and east respectively.</p>

<p>In fifteen days the British force had advanced sixty miles on its
right and about forty on its left. It had driven a Turkish army of
nine infantry divisions and one cavalry division out of a position in
which it had been intrenched for six months, and had pursued it,
giving battle whenever it attempted to stand, and inflicting on it
losses amounting probably to nearly two-thirds of its original
effectives. Over 9,000 prisoners, about eighty guns, more than 100
machine guns, and very large quantities of ammunition and other stores
had been captured.</p>

<p>After the capture of Junction Station on the morning of November 14,
1917, the British secured a position covering the station, while the
mounted troops reached Kezaze that same evening.</p>

<p>The mounted troops pressed on toward Ramleh and Ludd. On the right
Naaneh was attacked and captured in the morning, while on the left the
New Zealand Mounted Rifles had an engagement at Ayun Kara (six miles
south of Jaffa). Here the Turks made a determined counterattack and
got to within fifteen yards of the British line. A bayonet attack
drove them back with heavy loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225"></a>(p. 225)</span> Flanking the advance along the railway to Ramleh and covering
the main road from Ramleh to Jerusalem, a ridge stands up prominently
out of the low foothills surrounding it. This is the site of the
ancient Gezer, near which the village of Abu Shusheh now stands. A
Turkish rear guard had established itself on this feature. It was
captured on the morning of November 15, 1917, by mounted troops, who
galloped up the ridge from the south. A gun and 360 prisoners were
taken in this affair.</p>

<p>By the evening of November 15, 1917, the mounted troops had occupied
Ramleh and Ludd, and had pushed patrols to within a short distance of
Jaffa. At Ludd 300 prisoners were taken, and five destroyed aeroplanes
and a quantity of abandoned war material were found at Ramleh and
Ludd.</p>

<p>Jaffa was occupied without opposition on the evening of November 16,
1917.</p>

<p>The following situation had now developed: The Turkish army, cut in
two by the capture of Junction Station, had retired partly east into
the mountains toward Jerusalem and partly north along the plain. The
nearest line on which these two portions could reunite was the line
Tul Keram-Nablus. Reports indicated that it was the probable intention
of the Turks to evacuate Jerusalem and withdraw to reorganize on this
line.</p>

<p>The British mounted troops had been marching and fighting continuously
since October 31, 1917, and had advanced a distance of seventy-five
miles, measured in a straight line from Asluj to Jaffa. Other troops,
after heavy fighting at Gaza, had advanced in nine days a distance of
about forty miles, with two severe engagements and continual
advance-guard fighting. The 52d Division had covered sixty-nine miles
in this period.</p>

<p>The railway was being pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and every
opportunity was taken of landing stores at points along the coast. The
landing of stores was dependent on a continuance of favorable weather,
and might at any moment be stopped for several days together.</p>

<p>A pause was therefore necessary to await the progress of railway
construction, but before the British position in the plain could be
considered secure it was essential to obtain a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name="page226"></a>(p. 226)</span> hold of the
one good road which traverses the Judean range from north to south,
from Nablus to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The west side of the Judean range consists of a series of spurs
running east and west, and separated from one another by narrow
valleys. These spurs are steep, bare, and stony for the most part, and
in places precipitous. Between the foot of the spur of the main range
and the coastal plain is the low range known as the Shephelah.</p>

<p>On the line intended for the British advance only one good road, the
main Jaffa-Jerusalem road, traversed the hills from east to west. For
nearly four miles, between Bab el Wad (two-and one-half miles east of
Latron) and Saris, this road passes through a narrow defile, and it
had been damaged by the Turks in several places. The other roads were
mere tracks on the side of the hill or up the stony beds of wadis, and
were impracticable for wheeled transport without improvement.
Throughout these hills the water supply was scanty without
development.</p>

<p>On November 17, 1917, the Yeomanry had commenced to move from Ramleh
through the hills direct on Bireh by Annabeh, Berfilya, and Beit ur el
Tahta (Lower Beth Horon). By the evening of November 18, 1917, one
portion of the Yeomanry had reached the last-named place, while
another portion had occupied Shilta. The route had been found
impossible for wheels beyond Annabeh.</p>

<p>On November 19, 1917, the British infantry commenced its advance. One
portion was to advance up the main road as far as Kuryet el Enab, with
its right flank protected by Australian mounted troops. From that
place, in order to avoid any fighting in the close vicinity of the
Holy City, it was to strike north toward Bireh by a track leading
through Biddu. The remainder of the infantry was to advance through
Berfilya to Beir Likia and Beit Dukka, and thence support the movement
of the other portion.</p>

<p>After capturing Latron and Amnas on the morning of November 19, 1917,
the remainder of the day was spent in clearing the defile up to Saris,
which was defended by hostile rear guards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>(p. 227)</span> On November 20, 1917, Kuryet el Enab was captured with the
bayonet in the face of organized opposition, while Beit Dukka was also
captured. On the same day the Yeomanry got to within four miles of the
Nablus-Jerusalem road, but were stopped by strong opposition about
Beitunia.</p>

<p>On November 21, 1917, a body of infantry moved northeast by a track
from Kuryet el Enab through Biddu and Kulundia toward Bireh. The track
was found impassable for wheels, and was under hostile shell fire.
Progress was slow, but by evening the ridge on which stands Neby
Samwil was secured. A further body of troops was left at Kuryet el
Enab to cover the flank and demonstrate along the main Jerusalem road.
It drove hostile parties from Kustul two and one-half miles east of
Kuryet el Enab, and secured this ridge.</p>

<p>By the afternoon of November 21, 1917, advanced parties of Yeomanry
were within two miles of the road and an attack was being delivered on
Beitunia by other mounted troops.</p>

<p>The positions reached on the evening of November 21, 1917, practically
marked the limit of progress in this first attempt to gain the
Nablus-Jerusalem road. The Yeomanry were heavily counterattacked and
fell back, after bitter fighting, on Beit ur el Foka (Upper Beth
Horon). During the following day the Turks made two counterattacks on
the Neby Samwil ridge, which were repulsed. Determined attacks were
made on November 23 and 24, 1917, on the strong positions to the west
of the road held by the Turks, who had brought up reenforcements and
numerous machine guns, and could support their infantry by artillery
fire from guns placed in positions along the main road. British
artillery, from lack of roads, could not be brought up to give
adequate support to their infantry. Both attacks failed, and it was
evident that a period of preparation and organization would be
necessary before an attack could be delivered in sufficient strength
to drive the Turk from his positions west of the road.</p>

<p>By December 4, 1917, all preparations had been completed and the
British held a line from Kustul by the Neby Samwil ridge, Beit Izza,
and Beit Dukka, to Beit ur el Tahta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>(p. 228)</span> During this period of preparation attacks by the Turks along
the whole line led to severe local fighting. On November 25, 1917,
British advanced posts north of the river Auja were driven back across
the river. From November 27 to 28, 1917, the Turks delivered a series
of attacks directed especially against the high ground position in the
hills from Beit ur el Foka to El Burj, and the Neby Samwil ridge. An
attack on the night of November 29, 1917, succeeded in penetrating the
British outpost line northeast of Jaffa, but next morning the whole
Turkish detachment, numbering 150, was surrounded and captured by
Australian Light Horse. On November 30, 1917, a similar fate befell a
battalion which attacked near El Burj; a counterattack by Australian
Light Horse took 200 prisoners and practically destroyed the attacking
battalion. There was particularly heavy fighting between El Burj and
Beit ur el Folka, but the British troops successfully resisted all
attacks and inflicted severe losses on the enemy. At Beit ur el Foka
one company took 300 prisoners. All efforts by the Turks to drive the
British off the Neby Samwil ridge were completely repulsed. These
attacks cost the Turks very dearly. The British took 750 prisoners
between November 27 and 30, 1917, and the Turkish losses in killed and
wounded were undoubtedly heavy.</p>

<p>Favored by a continuance of fine weather, preparations for a fresh
advance against the Turkish positions west and south of Jerusalem
proceeded rapidly. Existing roads and tracks were improved and new
ones constructed to enable heavy and field artillery to be placed in
position and ammunition and supplies brought up. The water supply was
also developed.</p>

<p>The date for the attack was fixed as December 8, 1917. Welsh troops,
with a cavalry regiment attached, had advanced from their positions
north of Beersheba up the Hebron-Jerusalem road on December 4, 1917.
No opposition was met, and by the evening of December 6, 1917, the
head of this column was ten miles north of Hebron.</p>

<p>On December 7, 1917, the weather broke, and for three days rain was
almost continuous. The hills were covered with mist at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>(p. 229)</span>
frequent intervals, rendering observation from the air and visual
signaling impossible. A more serious effect of the rain was to
jeopardize the supply arrangements by rendering the roads almost
impassable.</p>

<p>In spite of these difficulties, the British troops moved into
positions by night, and, assaulting at dawn on December 8, 1917, soon
carried their first objectives. They then pressed steadily forward.
The mere physical difficulty of climbing the steep and rocky hillsides
and crossing the deep valleys would have sufficed to render progress
slow, and the opposition encountered was considerable. Artillery
support was soon difficult, owing to the length of the advance and the
difficulty of moving guns forward. But by about noon some British
troops had already advanced over two miles, and were swinging
northeast to gain the Nablus-Jerusalem road, while others had captured
the Beit Iksa spur, and were preparing for a further advance.</p>

<p>As the British right column had been delayed and was still some
distance south of Jerusalem, it was necessary for the advanced British
forces to throw back their right and form a defensive flank facing
east toward Jerusalem, from the western outskirts of which
considerable rifle and artillery fire was being experienced. This
delayed the advance, and early in the afternoon it was decided to
consolidate the line gained and resume the advance next day, when the
right column would be in a position to exert its pressure. By
nightfall the British line ran from Neby Samwil to the east of Beit
Iksa, through Lifta to a point about one and one-half miles west of
Jerusalem, whence it was thrown back facing east. All the Turkish
prepared defenses west and northwest of Jerusalem had been captured,
and the British troops were within a short distance of the
Nablus-Jerusalem road.</p>

<p>During the day about 300 prisoners were taken and many Turks killed.
British casualties were light.</p>

<p>Next morning the advance was resumed. The Turks had withdrawn during
the night, and the British forces driving back rear guards, occupied a
line across the Nablus-Jerusalem road <span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>(p. 230)</span> four miles north of
Jerusalem, while other troops occupied a position east of Jerusalem
across the Jericho road. These operations isolated Jerusalem, and at
about noon the enemy sent out a parlementaire and surrendered the
city.</p>

<p>At noon on December 11, 1917, General Allenby made his official entry
into Jerusalem.</p>

<p>In the operations from October 31 to December 9, 1917, over 12,000
prisoners were taken. The captures of material included about 100 guns
of various calibers, many machine guns, more than 20,000,000 rounds of
rifle ammunition, and 250,000 rounds of gun ammunition. More than
twenty aeroplanes were destroyed by British airmen or burned by the
Turks to avoid capture.</p>

<p>This ended four centuries of Turkish rule over the Holy City of Jews
and Christians. General Allenby, after his entry, issued the following
noteworthy proclamation:</p>

<p>"To the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Blessed and the people dwelling
in the vicinity. The defeat inflicted upon the Turks by the troops
under my command has resulted in the occupation of your city by my
forces. I therefore here and now proclaim it to be under martial law,
under which form of administration it will remain so long as military
considerations make it necessary. However, lest any of you should be
alarmed by reason of your experience at the hands of the enemy who
has retired, I hereby inform you that it is my desire that every
person should pursue his lawful business without fear of interruption.</p>

<p>"Furthermore, since your city is regarded with affection by the
adherents of three of the great religions of mankind, and its soil has
been consecrated by the prayers and pilgrimages of multitudes of
devout people of these three religions for many centuries, therefore
do I make known to you that every sacred building, monument, holy
spot, shrine, traditional site, endowment, pious bequest, or customary
place of prayer, of whatsoever form of the three religions, will be
maintained and protected according to the existing customs and beliefs
of those to whose faiths they are sacred."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>(p. 231)</span> An eyewitness of the memorable event, the special
correspondent of the London "Times" with the British forces describes
it in part as follows:</p>

<p>"It was a picturesque throng. From the outskirts of Jerusalem the
Jaffa road was crowded with people who flocked westward to greet the
conquering general. Somber-clad youths of all nationalities, including
Armenians and Greeks, stood side by side with Moslems dressed in the
brighter raiment of the East. The predominence of the tarboosh in the
streets added to the brightness of the scene. Many of the Moslems
joined aloud in the expression of welcome, and their faces lighted up
with pleasure at the general's approach.</p>

<p>"Flat-topped roofs and balconies held many, crying out a genuine
welcome; but it was in the streets, where the cosmopolitan crowd
assembled, that one looked for and obtained the real feeling of all
the peoples. What astonished me were the cries of 'Bravo' and 'Hurrah'
uttered by men who could have hardly spoken the words before....</p>

<p>"General Allenby entered the city on foot. Outside of Jaffa gate he
was received by the military governor and a guard of honor formed by
men who have done their full share in the campaign. On the right of
the gate were men from English, Scottish, Irish, and Welsh counties.
Opposite them were fifty men afoot, representing the Australian and
New Zealand horsemen who have been engaged in the Empire's work in
the Sinai Desert and Palestine almost since the war broke out. Inside
the walls were twenty French and twenty Italian troops from the
detachments sent by their countries to take part in the Palestine
operations.</p>

<p>"General Allenby entered by the ancient gate which is known to the
Arabs as 'The Friend.' Inside the walls was a crowd more densely
packed in the narrow streets than was the crowd outside.</p>

<p>"The commander in chief, preceded by his aids-de-camp, had on his
right the commander of the French detachment, and on his left the
commander of the Italian detachment. The Italian, French, and American
military attachés followed, together with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>(p. 232)</span> a few members of
the General Staff. The guards of honor marched in the rear. The
procession turned to the right into Mount Zion and halted at Al Kala
(the Citadel).</p>

<p>"On the steps, at the base of the Tower of David, which was standing
when Christ was in Jerusalem, the Proclamation of Military Law was
read, in the presence of the commander in chief and of many notables
of the city.</p>

<p>"Re-forming, the procession moved up Zion street to the barrack
square, where General Allenby received the notables and the heads of
the religious communities. The mayor and the mufti&mdash;the latter also a
member of the Husseiny family&mdash;were presented, likewise the sheiks in
charge of the mosques of Omar and Aksa, and Moslems belonging to the
Khaldieh and Alamieeh families, which trace their descents through
many centuries. The patriarchs of the Latin, Greek, Orthodox, and
Armenian Churches, and the Coptic bishop, had been directed by the
Turks to leave Jerusalem, but their representatives were introduced to
General Allenby, as were also the heads of the Jewish committees, the
Syrian Church, the Greek Catholic Church, the Abyssinian bishop, and a
representative of the Anglican Church. The last presentation was that
of the Spanish consul, who is in charge of the interests of almost all
the countries at war, and is a busy man."</p>


<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="title">PALESTINE&mdash;ARABIA&mdash;MESOPOTAMIA</p>


<p>Although the British had accomplished their main objective in
Palestine with the capture of Jerusalem, they did not rest on their
laurels. Within a few days after their occupation of the Holy City, by
December 12, 1917, they had advanced their lines to the north and some
detachments of Indian troops had carried positions as far north as the
mouth of the Midieh.</p>

<p>During the night of December 20-21, 1917, British troops crossing the
Nahr-el-Auja on rafts and light bridges, seized <span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233"></a>(p. 233)</span> Khurbet
Hadrah, Sheikh Muannis, Tel-er-Rekkeit, and later El Makhras.</p>

<p>These localities are near the mouth of the river, and include
commanding ground two miles to the north of it. Three hundred and five
prisoners, of whom eleven were officers, and ten machine guns were
captured.</p>

<p>Other forces captured Ras-ez-Zamby, two miles northeast of Bethany,
which itself is two miles east of Jerusalem, taking thirty prisoners
and two machine guns and beating off three Turkish counterattacks.</p>

<p>By this time the booty captured by the British since the beginning of
the operations had been counted and had been found to total
ninety-nine guns and howitzers with carriages, about 400 limbers,
wagons and other vehicles; 110 machine guns, more than 7,000 rifles,
18,500,000 rounds of small-arm ammunition, and over 58,000 rounds of
gun and howitzer ammunition, besides various other stores.</p>

<p>On December 22, 1917, troops on the extreme left of the British
forces, with naval cooperation, continued their advance north of the
Nahr-el-Auja, reaching the line Sheik-el-Ballutah-El Jelil, some four
miles north of the river. Pushing eastward south of the river Fejja
and Mulebbis, center of a Jewish colony, were occupied. This was
followed by the capture of Rantieh on the Turkish railway to the
north, and Kh.-el-Beida, and Kh.-el-Bireh, four miles southeast of
Rantieh.</p>

<p>The Turks, with German assistance, on December 27, 1917, made a
determined attempt to retake Jerusalem. Repeated attacks were pressed
with vigor and continued from two a. m. on the 27th for twenty-six
hours. General Allenby at once launched a counterattack against the
west flank of the Turkish attack.</p>

<p>On the 27th this attack progressed two and one-half miles over very
difficult country. Seeing that the Turkish attack was spent, on
December 28, 1917, the British made a general advance. British troops
on the Nablus road advancing north and the troops on their left
advancing east drove the Turks back before them. By the morning of
December 29, 1917, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>(p. 234)</span> General Allenby had secured the line
Burkah, Ras-et-Tahunieh, Ram Allah, El Tireh, Wadi-el-Kelh.</p>

<p>On December 30, 1917, British troops occupied Beitin, or Bethel, two
miles northeast of Bireh, El Balua, one mile north of Bireh, on the
Nablus road, and Kh.-el-Burj, about one mile west of El Balua, Janiah
and Ras Kerker, six and seven miles respectively northwest of Bireh.</p>

<p>In the coastal sector of the line a patrol reached Kuleh, twelve miles
east of Jaffa, and there found a Turkish gun ammunition depot, which
it destroyed. Kuleh is two miles east of Rantieh, on the Damascus
Railway, which had recently been occupied by the British.</p>

<p>The Turks suffered heavily in killed and wounded, the killed alone
being estimated at about 1,000. About 600 prisoners were taken and
twenty machine guns.</p>

<p>The British line was now, at its nearest point, twelve miles north of
Jerusalem. The right wing reached some four miles east of the Sheehem
road; the center extended across that road north of Beeroth, Bireh,
and along the Ram Allah Ridge and the Wadi-el-Kalb, which lies north
of and parallel to the Jerusalem-Beth Horon-Joppa road. On the coast
the left wing of the British was north of the Auja, in the plain of
Sharon.</p>

<p>In describing the Turco-German attempt to regain Jerusalem the special
correspondent of the London "Times" attached to the British forces in
Palestine said in part:</p>

<a id="img013" name="img013"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/img013.jpg">
<img src="images/img013tb.jpg" width="400" height="253" alt="" title=""></a>
<p class="smcap">The British advance in Mesopotamia and Palestine.</p>
</div>

<p>"The first objective was Tell-el-Ful, a high conical-shaped hill just
east of the Sheehem road dominating our lines east and west for a
considerable distance. During daylight on Boxing Day the Turks made no
movement, but just before midnight our post north of El Ful was driven
in. At twenty minutes past one a. m. the first attack on El Ful was
made, and at the same time an advance began against Beit Hannina,
about a mile west of the road. This line was defended by London
Territorials, who added to their grand record by meeting attack after
attack with magnificent steadiness, standing like rocks against most
furious onslaughts, and never once yielding an inch of ground. Two
companies defending Hanbna were attacked <span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236"></a>(p. 236)</span> four times by
storming troops. Each attack was stronger than the last, and the
fourth was delivered by 500 picked Turks, but all the attacks were
beaten back after prolonged hand-to-hand fighting. The enemy dead
showed many bayonet wounds, and the hillside was strewn with Turks
killed by machine-gun fire. There were eight attacks on Tell-el-Ful.
These were also made with great weight and determination. The
strongest of them all was delivered with a reenforced line at dawn,
and supported by heavy artillery fire. All were defeated with great
loss to the enemy.</p>

<p>"Between 7 a. m. and noon the enemy organized for a last big effort,
and about half-past 12 the Turks assaulted the whole of the Londoners'
line except Nebi Samwil. This final attack was pressed right up to our
positions, the enemy fighting with the bravery of desperation. He
proved no match for the London Territorials, who, after raking the
advancing waves with machine guns, cleared his breastworks at a bound,
met the foe with the bayonet, and forced him back.</p>

<p>"General Allenby, realizing how deeply committed the Turks were to the
attack on Jerusalem, put in Irish and dismounted Yeomanry against the
enemy right. Those who have seen the terrain marvel at the dismounted
Yeomanry's and Irishmen's achievement. They moved from Beth Horon
Upper northeastward. The Yeomen attacked El Tireh, at the time not
strongly held, but just as they secured it a Turkish storming
battalion was advancing to the same spot. The enemy, thus forestalled,
counterattacked, but the Yeomanry rushed at them and counted seventy
Turks killed by the bayonet alone.</p>

<p>"The hill near by was so steep that it took two hours to get supplies
up to the top. Another hillside was so precipitous that the only way
troops could get up the terraced slopes was by the men standing on
each other's shoulders. So nearly perpendicular was the hill that the
Turks on the top could not fire on the climbers till they were at
close quarters. While the Irish and Yeomen were advancing, men in
reserve were making roads for the guns, which had to be hauled by
hand, and when Yeomen captured Beitunia they had a whole brigade of
guns just behind <span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>(p. 237)</span> their front line, though it was sometimes
necessary for a whole company of infantry to haul one gun, which at
moments was dangling in the air.</p>

<p>"Welsh and Home Counties troops also took part in beating off the
attack on Jerusalem. They had taken Zanby and White Hill, north of the
Jericho road, and held White Hill against three counterattacks. On the
27th the Turks attacked all day, and White Hill became no-man's-land,
but Zanby was held. Fighting was at bombing distance. At dusk the
enemy tried to take White Hill, but the Welshmen charged with the
bayonet and killed over a hundred Turks. Farther south a post at the
village of Obeid was attacked by 700 of the enemy, who surrounded it
and fired 400 shells into the monastery, but the Middlesex men, who
were the garrison of the post, held out, their casualties being
trifling."</p>

<p>Immediately following the defeat which the British inflicted on the
Turks, the former succeeded in advancing their lines north of
Jerusalem still another mile.</p>

<p>During January, 1918, there was little activity on the Palestine
front. In the last week of the month there was, however, considerable
aerial activity. On January 22, 1918, the Turkish camps and depots on
the railway west of Sebustieh, Samaria, were raided.</p>

<p>On January 24, 1918, two Turkish aeroplanes were wrecked in aerial
combats.</p>

<p>On January 25, 1918, British bombing squadrons surprised a body of
some 2,000 Turkish troops in close formation near Hawara, on the
Jerusalem-Nablus road four and one-half miles south of Nablus. Half a
ton of bombs were dropped on the column before it could disperse. At
the same time a camp of mounted troops was bombed and the animals were
stampeded.</p>

<p>Twelve Turkish aeroplanes were destroyed during the month of January,
1918.</p>

<p>During the night of January 30, 1918, the British line was again
advanced slightly in the vicinity of Arnutieh, a ruined site, on the
Sheehem road, twelve miles north of Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>(p. 238)</span> On the morning of January 31, 1918, a British reconnoitering
detachment penetrated the village of Mukhmas, eight miles
north-northeast of Jerusalem, repulsed Turkish counterattacks, and
withdrew during the following night, having accomplished its object.
During the night of February 2, 1918, Turkish patrols were active
between Arnutieh and Sheikh Abdulla, one mile east of Arnutieh.
Attempts to penetrate the British lines at these points, however, were
repulsed.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Arab revolt in the Hedjaz, that part of Arabia
adjoining the Red Sea, was spreading. It will be recalled that it had
been announced in July, 1917, that the Turks had been defeated at Maan
and that the Arabs had occupied the enemy positions between Maan and
Akaba, the latter place being at the head of the Red Sea gulf of the
same name, and just east of the Egyptian frontier. The town of Maan,
which is on the Hedjaz Railway, is about 120 miles southeast of Gaza.</p>

<p>Late in August, 1917, it became known that forces operating under the
orders of the King of the Hedjaz, the Grand Sherif of Mecca, had
carried out a series of extensive operations against Turkish
detachments and posts in Arabia. According to the information
available, the Arab forces had been working on a carefully thought out
plan, resulting in the destruction of part of the railway line north
of Medina, which is 230 miles north of Mecca, and in the capture of
isolated Turkish posts.</p>

<p>In the Maan district alone, over 700 Turks were killed in action and
a similar number taken prisoner, in addition to four guns.</p>

<p>The Arab movement, originating with the Sherif of Mecca, apparently
was gaining the support of almost all the Arab tribes in the Hedjaz,
and was spreading eastward.</p>

<p>During September, 1917, no news came from the Hedjaz. Early in
October, 1917, it was reported that Arab forces had successfully
raided the railway communications north of Medina on the Hedjaz
Railway.</p>

<p>Not until late in December, 1917, did it become known that the Arabs
had been quite active during the latter part of November, 1917, though
definite news was lacking concerning their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>(p. 239)</span> activities during
October, 1917, and the early part of November, 1917.</p>

<p>Between November 8 and November 12, 1917, a section of Arabs attacked
the railway from Deraa to Amman, that part of the Hedjaz line running
parallel to the Jordan. Two locomotives, a number of coaches and
trucks, and a bridge were destroyed, and traffic was interrupted for
six days.</p>

<p>On November 11, 1917, a train in which Djemal Pasha was traveling to
Jerusalem was blown up with a mine and destroyed. Djemal escaped, but
his aid-de-camp and the staff officers accompanying him were killed.
The Turkish casualties amounted to 120, while the Arabs lost seven
killed and four wounded.</p>

<p>On November 22, 1917, a Turkish lancer patrol from Maan attacked some
Arab tents in the neighborhood of Batra, fifteen miles southwest of
Maan, but were driven off with losses. Arab forces later took the
posts of Fuweila and Basta, southwest and west of Maan respectively.
These points had been fortified by the Turks in August last in the
hope of confining the Arabs in the Akaba area.</p>

<p>A few days later it was announced that an Arab force under Sherif
Feisal, son of the King of Hedjaz, had destroyed a troop train south
of Tebuk, on the Hedjaz Railway, some 350 miles north of Medina.</p>

<p>The whole of the Turkish detachment in the train were killed or
captured, amongst the former being Suleiman Pasha Rifada, paramount
chief of the Billi tribe. Three hundred rifles were captured as well
as a large quantity of ammunition, also £24,000 Turkish in gold.</p>

<p>On January 11, 1918, it was announced that the Arab forces in Hedjaz
had made a successful raid on the railway some twenty miles south of
Maan, and that still farther to the south the entire Turkish garrison
of an important post on the railway had fallen into the hands of the
Arabs.</p>

<p>A few days later the Arabs occupied the Turkish post of Tafile,
forty-five miles north-northeast of Maan and eighteen miles southeast
of the Dead Sea, capturing the entire garrison. On January 26, 1918, a
body of Turkish troops moving on Tafile <span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>(p. 240)</span> from El Kerak, twenty
miles northeast of the southern end of the Dead Sea, was routed on the
Seil-el-Hesa, eleven miles north of Tafile, by the Arabs, and driven
back in disorder with the loss of many prisoners, a mountain gun, and
seven machine guns.</p>

<p>On the same day another Turkish force advancing westward from Maan was
repulsed by Arab troops near Ain Uheid, seven miles west of Maan.</p>

<p>Still farther south, in the Aden sector of Arabia, little of
importance transpired between August, 1917, and February, 1918, though
the British troops near Aden continued to be in constant contact with
the Turks, engaging in numerous outpost and patrol skirmishes.</p>

<p>On November 22, 1917, an action was fought on a larger scale than
usual, in which British troops attacked and captured the Turkish post
at Jabir, fifteen miles north of Aden, and its neighboring pickets.
Losses were inflicted on the Turks and their defenses were destroyed.</p>

<p>On January 5, 1918, a strong reconnoissance was made toward Hatum and
Jabir, the defenses of the former being destroyed by British troops.
Aeroplanes cooperated with the British artillery, who inflicted
considerable damage on the Turkish infantry.</p>

<p>In Mesopotamia there had been very little activity since the fall of
Bagdad on March 11, 1917. Soon after that event a British column had
been sent westward to Feluja on the Euphrates, a town almost on a line
with Bagdad, but about thirty-five miles farther west. The Turks had
offered no resistance and the town had been occupied by the British.
The Turkish forces in the meantime had been withdrawn to Ramadie,
about twenty-five miles northwest from Feluja and also on the
Euphrates. In July 1917, a British column had successfully pushed
forward about twelve miles in the direction of Ramadie, but after
inflicting considerable losses on the Turks had to stop farther
advance on account of the extreme heat.</p>

<p>Early in October, 1917, came the news that Ramadie had fallen on
September 29, 1917. During the night of September 27, 1917, the
British had moved in two columns from an <span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>(p. 241)</span> advanced camp on the
Euphrates, west of Feluja, one column on the right, the other on the
left, and at dawn they attacked Mushaid Ridge, a low line of dunes
running north and south from the Euphrates to Habbanie Canal.</p>

<p>At dawn they bombarded the main crest of the ridge, but the Turks had
evacuated it, and they replied with a counterbombardment a few minutes
afterward, expecting apparently that the British would follow up the
barrage with an assault. The British, however, as soon as it became
clear that the Turks were evacuating Mushaid Ridge, changed their line
of attack. The right column was withdrawn and, swinging round west
behind the left column, became the left wing of the force.</p>

<p>As soon as the infantry had carried Mushaid Ridge British cavalry made
a wide sweeping movement across the desert round the right flank of
the Turks. They left the battle area at 8 a. m. and by 4 p. m. they
were established astride the Aleppo road on a regular line of hills
running at right angles with the river five miles west of Ramadie.</p>

<p>By this move the Turks were cornered. The net which the British had
flung round them was complete. They had no bridge behind them and were
cut off from all hope of reenforcement or supplies. Their only chance
was to drive in determined counterattacks, and to break through
before the British drew the ring in closer and drove them out from
their trenches with their artillery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the British infantry were closing in. At 1 o'clock, after
bombardment, one column attacked Ramadie Ridge, on the right, while
the other was working round to Azizie Ridge, on the left. The capture
and holding of Ramadie Ridge by British and Indian infantry was a
difficult achievement. This low pebbly rise is perfectly smooth, a
long and gentle gradient barely seventeen feet above the plain level.
It offered no cover of any kind, and the British infantry became
visible to the Turks a full 200 yards before they reached the top of
the rise. As soon as they came into view the Turks opened concentrated
rifle and machine-gun fire on the British front and right flank, while
their guns opened intense enfilade fire from the batteries on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>(p. 242)</span> left. The British and Indian soldiers hung on to their
positions and at night dug themselves in. Their action so occupied the
Turks that the left column was able to work round and seize the Azizie
Ridge before dusk with very little opposition.</p>

<p>At night British cavalry, who occupied strong points on a front of
three miles along the ridge, prepared for a desperate struggle. The
expected attack began the battle after 3 o'clock, when the Turks tried
to break through between the cavalry and the river. The action
continued for two hours till dawn, when it degenerated into casual
sniping. The nearest Turkish dead were found within fifty yards of the
cavalry trenches.</p>

<p>In the meantime the infantry soon after daybreak had taken up the
attack again and in face of well-directed fire and against repeated
counterattacks, had carried the last outlying defenses of the Turks on
the British left, until 8 o'clock, September 29, 1917, they had seized
and were holding the bridgehead of the Azizie Canal. After this new
repulse an intense bombardment was opened on the Turkish trenches. The
British line of cavalry, far away west, soon saw the dark masses of
the enemy approaching and apparently prepared for bloody battle. They
watched this advance, as they thought, for over an hour, but there
came a moment when, to their astonishment, they saw the Turks turn and
walk in mass formation toward the British. The Turkish guns were
silent and white flags went up all along the line.</p>

<p>It was a general surrender. Ahmed Bey, the Turkish commander, who had
been on the Euphrates all through the campaign from the battle of
Shaiba, March, 1915, came out and surrendered with his whole force.</p>

<p>The British captured 3,455 prisoners, thirteen guns, ten machine guns,
1,061 rifles, a quantity of ammunition, some railway material, two
steam launches and a large quantity of miscellaneous engineering
material, equipment, and military stores. When the British entered
Ramadie they found that such Turkish forces as had not surrendered had
hurriedly fled.</p>

<p>To the north and east of Bagdad the British forces, too, succeeded in
advancing in the direction of the Persian border. In <span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>(p. 243)</span> this
undertaking they had for some time the cooperation of Russian troops
still fighting in this region.</p>

<p>On August 19, 1917, British columns attacked the Turks near Shahroban
on the left bank of the Dialah, about fifty miles northeast from
Bagdad. The Turks made little resistance and retreated hastily to the
Hamrin Hills, and British troops remained in possession of Shahroban.</p>

<p>In an action fought on October 20, 1917, the British occupied Deli
Abbas, about ten miles northwest from Shahroban, and established
themselves on the Jebel Hamrin range on the left bank of the river
Dialah. The Turks retreated across the Dialah River in the vicinity of
Kizil Robat, burning the bridge behind them, and continued to hold a
position in the hills on the right bank of that river, north of Deli
Abbas, which is on the Bagdad-Kifri road.</p>

<p>This position was attacked on the morning of December 3, 1917, by
converging columns, one of which successfully bridged the Dialah near
Kizil Robat, sixty miles northeast of Bagdad, on the road to Khanikin.</p>

<p>The Turks attempted to delay the British advance by flooding the area
between the Nahrin and Dialah Rivers close to their junction, six
miles east of Deli Abbas, but by the morning of December 4, 1917,
British troops had driven back the Turks and were in possession of
the Sakaltutan Pass, eleven miles north of Deli Abbas, and between the
Dialah and the Nahrin, a northern tributary of the Dialah, flowing
through the Jebel Hamrin, and crossed on the main road between Deli
Abbas and Kifri at an elevation of 600 feet above sea level. Through
the Sakaltutan Pass the road from Deli Abbas leads to the north to
Kifri and Mosul.</p>

<p>A force of Russians, under the command of Colonel Bicharakoff,
operated on the British right flank and rendered valuable assistance.</p>

<p>Immediately after the capture of the pass, the Turks were pursued as
far as the village of Kara Tepe, thirteen miles north of the pass and
about twenty-five miles north of Deli Abbas, through which the Turks
were driven on December 5, 1917, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>(p. 244)</span> after a sharp engagement.
The pursuit was carried out over difficult country containing bogs and
intersected by numerous watercourses.</p>

<p>On the morning of December 7, 1917, British aeroplanes bombed Tuz
Kurmatli, on the Mosul road, thirty-five miles north of Kara Tepe,
with good results. It was reported that the Turks set fire to the
Kifri coal mines on December 5, 1917, and the British observed that
fires were burning there on the following day.</p>

<p>No further news came from the Mesopotamian theater of war during the
balance of December, 1917, or during January and February, 1918.</p>

<p>On December 1, 1917, it was officially announced by the British
authorities, that reconnoissances had definitely established the fact
that German East Africa had been completely cleared of all German
troops and that the German commander, General von Lettow-Vorbeck, with
the force under his command, estimated at 2,000 rifles, had crossed
the Rovuma River into Portuguese East Africa.</p>

<p>During December, 1917, after driving the Germans across the border
into Portuguese territory, the British forces were busy in preparing
for the new task of hunting out General Lettow-Vorbeck in Portuguese
East Africa. British patrols by December 25, 1917, were forty miles
south of the Rovuma River, which marks the frontier.</p>

<p>Von Lettow's force had been broken up into small foraging parties; and
it was expected that they would be rounded up before the big rains set
in.</p>

<p>However, during the last few days of December, 1917, the German forces
in Mozambique, consisting of 2,000 men with two fieldpieces and ten
machine guns, attacked the Portuguese positions on Mt. M'Kula,
occupied by Captain Curado, with 250 men and five machine guns, and
after three days' fighting succeeded in carrying the positions by
assault.</p>

<p>This did not change the fact that the last vestige of the German
Colonial Empire had fallen into the hands of the Allies.</p>


<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>(p. 245)</span> PART VI&mdash;THE BALKANS</h2>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="title">THE BALKANS&mdash;GREECE AND MACEDONIA</p>


<p>On the Macedonian front the military situation has had all the
appearance of a deadlock, not only since last summer, but for the past
year. On November 24, 1917, the Austrians were reported to be making a
general offensive attack on the Italian lines in southern Albania,
between the Voyusa and Osum Rivers, which was followed by a strong
Italian counterattack, but neither side was able to announce any gains
of territory or any notable capture of prisoners or material. Again,
barely two weeks later, on December 5, 1917, violent fighting was said
to have begun for several miles along the front near the Struma, with
the net result that "several Bulgarian patrols were captured."
Compared to what we have come to regard as fighting in this war,
therefore, these few sporadic efforts in Macedonia and Albania have
been very little more than outpost affairs, mere raids.</p>

<p>On November 15, 1917, there was published in London a report on the
military activities of the British by General G. F. Milne, commanding
the British forces covering the past year, which seems in part to have
a significant bearing on a later event.</p>

<p>In the latter part of February, 1917, a year ago, General Milne was
instructed by General Sarrail to prepare for a forward push against
the Bulgarians in the first week of April. A corps was, accordingly,
sent forward shortly afterward to take a position on the high ridge
between Lake Doiran and the River <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>(p. 246)</span> Vardar. By April 8, 1917,
General Milne was ready, whereupon General Sarrail found it necessary
to postpone action until the 24th. On that day the British were sent
forward and succeeded in occupying the front-line trenches of the
enemy almost along the entire front of the attack. The British were
now in a commanding position, of which great advantage could have been
taken, but at this juncture General Milne was instructed to retire,
"on account of the unhealthful conditions of the terrain."</p>

<p>General Milne was next informed that the advance would begin over
again on May 8, 1917. So another assault on the enemy lines was begun
between Lake Doiran and the "Petite Couronne" Hill. In spite of the
powerful opposition of the Bulgarians some progress was made, and
twelve days later the new advance line was consolidated. A farther
advance was in progress, with every prospect of success, when on May
24, 1917, General Milne received instructions from Sarrail to cease
all offensive operations.</p>

<p>By itself this report might at least indicate unpleasant relations
between the British and the French commanders, but further
significance is added by the announcement made December 19, 1917, that
General Sarrail had been recalled from his supreme command on the
Macedonian front, to be succeeded by General Guillemet.</p>

<p>A serious charge, it will be remembered, had been made against Sarrail
in France before his appointment to Saloniki, in July, 1915. This
charge had been made by General Dubail and had been indorsed by
General Joffre and Millerand, then Minister of War in the French
Cabinet. It had to do with certain maneuvers against the German Crown
Prince, directed by Sarrail under the command of Dubail. Subsequently
these charges were dropped, and until his sudden appointment to the
Saloniki command Sarrail dropped from view.</p>

<p>The specific reason for Sarrail's removal has not been officially
stated, but there are rumors throwing doubt on his loyalty and
suggesting his connection with the Caillaux scandal, which would imply
that Sarrail had deliberately made no efforts to proceed seriously
against the Bulgarians and the Austrians, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>(p. 247)</span> even that he had
secretly connived in the destruction of the Rumanians when he should
have created a diversion by a general attack in Macedonia.</p>

<p>The double part played by Constantine, King of Greece, in the dealings
with the Entente Powers, had always been a matter of grave suspicion,
in spite of his repeated denials and protestations of friendship,
published through his frequent newspaper interviews. Even after his
removal from the throne by the Allies there still remained a doubt in
the minds of many people that he had been justly treated. But then his
duplicity has been conclusively proved beyond all question.</p>

<p>Early in November, 1917, there were discovered in Athens the records
of a number of telegrams which had been exchanged between Constantine
and Queen Sophia on the one hand and her brother, the kaiser, on the
other. These telegrams were in a cipher code unknown to the Greek
foreign office. The key was discovered later and the contents of the
telegrams revealed clearly, exposing a series of plots which had been
initiated by the Greek sovereigns against their supposed friends, the
Allies.</p>

<p>Those sent early in 1916, by both the king and the queen, urgently
requested the kaiser to institute an energetic military movement in
the Balkans toward Greece, that Greece might be relieved from the
presence of the Allied troops in the neighborhood. Then came the
affair in which the Greek military authorities surrendered Fort Rupel
to the Bulgarians, showing conclusively that the king had connived in
the surrender.</p>

<p>At the time of the crisis, in the first days of December, 1916, when
the Greek army attacked Entente representatives in Athens and caused
an ultimatum to be delivered against the Greek Government, Queen
Sophia, in a long telegram to her brother, described the "splendid
victory" which the Greeks had achieved over "four great powers." In
this telegram she demanded a strong German and Austrian offensive with
the object of relieving Greece. In reply the kaiser urged Constantine
to declare war against Sarrail's forces and begin active military
operations against them. In reply the queen explained the
impossibility of doing this on account of the lack of equipment
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>(p. 248)</span> and ammunition and again urged a German relief expedition. To
this the German Emperor answered that this was impossible, but urged
that Constantine take measures to organize guerrilla bands in the
neighborhood of Lake Ochrida, to cooperate with the Austrian forces.
This suggestion was complied with, no less a person than the Master of
the King's Horse being intrusted with the supervision of this task.
The following telegram, sent on January 10, 1917, is a notable example
of this correspondence in general:</p>

<p>"For the Kaiser from Queen Sophia (through the Greek Minister in
Berlin):</p>

<p>"I thank you for your telegram, but we are without sufficient food for
the duration of such an undertaking, and the shortage of ammunition
and many other things compel us unfortunately to abstain from such
offensive action. You can realize my position. How I suffer. Thank you
warmly for your welcome words. <i>May the infamous swine receive the
punishment they deserve.</i> I embrace you heartily. Your exiled and
unhappy sister, who hopes for better times. (<i>Signed</i>) <span class="smcap">Sophia</span>."</p>

<p>Another telegram from Sophia, sent on this same day, stated to the
kaiser "I am grateful and happy for having at any rate spoken to Von
Falkenhausen at Larissa on the telephone, as well as having received
direct news of you. I was afraid the ultimatum would have to be
accepted. We were obliged to accept it, although we desired to enter
the war on the side of Germany on account of the political advantages,
in order to rid ourselves of our bitter enemies, and to respond to the
sympathy already shown by the Greek people to the cause of Germany,
but we lack food and ammunition for such a campaign.... Finally, the
immediate menace to the capital and to our only means of communication
by the British forces reported to be at Malta for the expedition
against Greece obliged us to our great regret to abandon this
project...."</p>

<p>On January 6, 1917, King Constantine sent a telegram to Von
Hindenburg, in which the following passages occur:</p>

<p>"The present situation must be seriously considered, as it is probable
that a declaration of war might come before mobilization <span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>(p. 249)</span>
could be effected. Probably the Entente desire to involve Greece in
immediate war so as to destroy her before the German occupation could
begin. Already Greece is faced with a fresh Entente note demanding her
complete disarmament. The transport of the whole of the artillery and
war material to the Peloponnesus is being maintained by the pressure
of the blockade. The Government and the people are resisting with
constancy, enduring all sorts of privations, but the situation is
growing worse from day to day. It is urgent that we should be informed
if a German attack on the Macedonian front is contemplated, and when
it is likely to begin."</p>

<p>That these intrigues were not confined to Constantine and Sophia alone
is obvious, from the following telegram, sent by Theotokis, the Greek
Minister in Berlin, on December 10, 1916:</p>

<p>"Let Von Falkenhausen await at Berlin the decision which will be taken
at Athens. In case it is neutrality he will proceed to Podgradetz; in
case of rupture with the Entente he will go by aeroplane to Larissa.
In any case, it is of the greatest importance to develop as quickly as
possible the question of Caravitis's bands and matters relative
thereto. Pray inform me with all speed what assistance in the way of
munitions, money, and provisions you would want. The object of
Caravitis should be to cut the railroad from Monastir to Saloniki, and
harass Sarrail's rear. One should not lose sight of the fact that
even this unofficial action by the bands will powerfully help Greece
when the time for negotiations comes to put forward large territorial
claims which, naturally, can be larger in case action is taken than in
case of mere neutrality. Falkenhausen is awaiting instructions, upon
which he will act immediately."</p>

<p>On December 2, 1916, Sophia telegraphed to General von Falkenhausen:</p>

<p>"Owing to the continuance of the blockade there is only bread left for
a few days longer, and other foodstuffs are also growing scarcer. The
idea of war against the Entente is now out of the question.
Negotiations are now proceeding on the note. I consider the game lost.
If the attack is not made immediately, it will be too late."</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>(p. 250)</span> CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p class="title">RUMANIA</p>


<p>For six months the Rumanian troops engaged in no important military
operations. They held their lines against the Austrian forces, and
these latter, apparently, made no strong efforts to advance. Indeed,
the entire collapse of the military power of Russia made it
practically certain that the Rumanians could not continue the war
effectively. When the Bolsheviki came into power, their course toward
Rumania was openly hostile, so that the Rumanians were compelled to
guard themselves against their one-time allies as well as against the
enemy.</p>

<p>Finally Rumania joined in the armistice initiated by the Petrograd
Bolsheviki. There seemed to be no question of the desire of the
Rumanians to remain loyal to their western allies; but the Balkan
country was now surrounded by enemies, and there was apparently little
hope that she could maintain her warfare against the Central Powers.
Reports from Austrian sources stated that negotiations for a separate
peace between Austria and Rumania were going on at Fokshani. Peace
with Germany, Turkey, and Bulgaria would naturally follow to save the
country from utter destruction.</p>

<p>On January 20, 1917, a Berlin dispatch announced that the Rumanian
Premier, Bratiano, had resigned, and was to be succeeded by General
Averescu, former Minister of War and commander in chief of the
Rumanian forces which had operated in Dobrudja. This report has not
since been verified.</p>

<p>That Bulgaria is not completely under German control and is a member
of the Quadruple Alliance on terms peculiarly her own has been
manifested in more than one way during recent months. As previously
stated, in earlier editions of this work, there is a very strong
popular opinion in Bulgaria against the alliance with Germany which at
times has seemed on the point of manifesting itself in a material way.
Occasionally rumors have come through of wholesale military
executions, following <span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>(p. 251)</span> attempts at mutiny on the part of the
troops. Thus Bulgaria's position as an uncertain quantity in the
Teutonic alliance is not due to any disloyalty on the part of the
king, Ferdinand, but to the disposition of the people, who are
interested only in a Macedonia free from Serbia or Greece, and not in
the German plans for empire. Though successfully suppressed so far,
these subterranean movements do limit the policy of the Bulgarian
ruling clique, however loyal to German rule it may be in itself.</p>

<p>During the past November there were frequent rumors of proposal from
Bulgaria to the Entente for separate peace, but nothing definite was
known at the time. That definite negotiations were at least begun only
became known in December, 1917, when the Petrograd Bolsheviki began
the publication of secret treaties and correspondence found in the
Government archives on their stepping into power. Among these many
revelations appeared a telegram from the Russian embassy in Berne,
Switzerland, which described a meeting in the embassy office in the
latter part of September, 1917, between a Bulgarian representative,
said to be the exarch of the Bulgarian church, and a British
representative, whose name was not given. The latter asked for a
statement of the Bulgarian terms.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian demanded, in return for severing the alliance with
Germany and Austria, that Bulgaria be granted all of Dobrudja, an
expanded Bulgaria down to the old Media-Rodosto line, with a western
frontier along the Morava River, in Serbia, from the junction of that
river with the Danube, down through Nish, Pristina, and Uskub; and
Macedonia, including Monastir and Saloniki.</p>

<p>This demand the British representative refused to consider, but made
the tentative counterproposal of an independent Macedonia, with
Saloniki as the capital.</p>

<p>That Bulgaria should have refused this offer is only another
illustration of the duplicity of Ferdinand and his governing clique.
His one hold on the Bulgarian people has been his pretended espousal
of the cause of the Macedonian Bulgars. For long years past the
Macedonians strove for an independent Macedonia, but this was made
impossible by the policies of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>(p. 252)</span> great powers interested.
They were, however, on the verge of achieving this ideal after the
First Balkan War, when the interference of Austria in Albania caused
Serbia and Greece to demand a revision of the treaty which had
provided for Macedonian freedom. Against this demand the Macedonians
protested, and their leaders were largely instrumental in
precipitating the Second Balkan War. The result was their defeat and
the Treaty of Bucharest, which forced the Macedonian patriots under
the wing of the Bulgarian Government, the only refuge left them.</p>

<p>That Bulgaria should now have refused terms including an independent
Macedonia was, indeed, a matter to be kept secret. Ferdinand,
naturally, desires Macedonia as an extension of his own territory,
although the Macedonians are very little in sympathy with his Greater
Bulgaria imperialism and would only accept it as an alternative
between freedom on the one hand and subjection to Greece and Serbia on
the other.</p>

<p>On October 12, 1917, Emperor William of Germany, accompanied by Prince
August Wilhelm and Foreign Secretary Dr. von Kühlmann, paid an
official visit to Ferdinand in Sofia. The streets and houses were
profusely decorated and much festivity prevailed.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<p class="title">ON THE SEA</p>


<p>As in the past, naval warfare during the six months' period, August,
1917, to February, 1918, consisted primarily of attacks by German
submarines on units of the allied merchant marine. There was again a
wide discrepancy between the figures published by the allied and
German governments. An example of this are the respective totals of
monthly tonnage losses for the year 1917.</p>

U-boat attacks, mine and other explosions. Of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>(p. 255)</span> these 3,828

<p>This meant a loss of about 61,000 tons and of 177 lives.</p>

<p>Unrestricted submarine warfare was initiated by the Germans, it will
be remembered, on February 1, 1917. During the first twelve months of
it, February, 1917, to February, 1918, a total of sixty-nine American
ships, representing about 170,000 <span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>(p. 256)</span> tons, were sunk by
submarines, mines, and raiders. Over 300 lives were lost with these
boats.</p>

<p>Figures in regard to the French and Italian losses are incomplete.
From available sources, however, it appears that during the six
months' period, August, 1917, to February, 1918, the French merchant
marine lost by U-boat attacks seventy-three steamers of over 1,600
tons, fifty-two steamers of under 1,600 tons and thirty fishing boats.
In the same period U-boats sank sixty-one Italian steamers and
forty-six Italian sailing vessels.</p>

<p>Regarding neutral losses figures are even less definite. Only Norway,
which again is by far the heaviest loser amongst neutral nations, has
published official statements covering her losses. For six months,
July to December, 1917, her losses were 127 boats of 216,000 tons. For
the entire year 1917, they amounted to 434 boats of 686,800 tons and
involved the death of 401 sailors, while 258 more were missing or
unaccounted for.</p>

<p>Holland, amongst other losses, reported the sinking by a mine off the
Dutch coast on August 3, 1917, of the steamer <i>Moordam</i> of 12,531
tons. Mines in one case, and an explosion in the other, were
responsible for the sinking of two British steamers: <i>City of
Athens</i>, of Cape Town, of 5,600 tons, on August 10, 1917, with the
loss of nineteen lives, of which five were Americans; and <i>Port
Kembla</i>, of 4,700 tons, on September 18, 1917, off Cape Farewell.</p>

<p>Regarding the German losses in U-boats, practically no definite
information is available. Only occasionally has any news managed to
get by the censors of the Allies, and the Germans, of course, are
entirely silent on the subject. On November 24, 1917, one U-boat was
sunk by the United States destroyers, <i>Fanning</i> and <i>Nicholson</i>, while
on patrol service in European waters. Her crew were captured with the
exception of a few members who were drowned. Two other U-boats were
reported to have been sunk during December in the Ionian Sea by a
French destroyer. This, of course, does not represent the total losses
inflicted by the Allies on the German U-boat forces. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>(p. 257)</span> Indeed,
it has been stated officially that the average loss amounts to
thirty-eight U-boats per month.</p>

<p>Naval engagements between units of the various belligerents were
comparatively few and unimportant. As a result the losses incurred by
the different navies, at least as far as they became known, were
likewise comparatively slight.</p>

<p>During August, 1917, British monitors cooperated with the Italian navy
in bombarding successfully Austrian positions in the Gulf of Trieste.
On August 16, 1917, there was also a slight engagement between British
and German destroyers in the North Sea without result.</p>

<p>On September 1, 1917, British destroyers destroyed four German armed
mine-sweeping vessels off the coast of Jutland. Three days later,
September 4, 1917, a German submarine bombarded Scarborough, killing
three persons, wounding five, and doing some material damage.</p>

<p>During the successful German attack against Riga in the early part of
September, 1917, German submarines appeared in the Gulf of Riga and
bombarded the city.</p>

<p>In October it also became known that the German raider <i>Seeadler</i> had
run ashore on Lord Howe Island (Society Islands) in the Pacific Ocean,
leaving forty-seven prisoners on the island in a state of destitution.
The crew of the raider afterward seized a motor sloop and a French
schooner on which they carried out some further raids. It was later
reported that the motor boat had been captured by an unarmed
merchantman in one of the outlying islands of the Fiji group.</p>

<p>The armored British cruiser <i>Drake</i> was torpedoed on the morning of
October 2, 1917, off the north coast of Ireland. Though she was able
to make harbor, she sank later in shallow water. One officer and
eighteen men were killed by the explosion of the torpedo. The <i>Drake</i>
was a ship of 14,100 tons with a speed of 24.11 knots and had been
launched in 1902. She was a sister ship of the <i>Good Hope</i> sunk off
Coronel in November, 1914, during the battle with the German Pacific
fleet.</p>

<p>Strong German naval forces participated in the fighting in the Gulf of
Riga which took place in the middle of October <span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>(p. 258)</span> 1917. They
were prominent in enabling German troops to land on Oesel and Dagö
Islands and later on Moon Island. It was reported that during an
engagement between German and Russian naval forces the Germans lost
two destroyers, not, however, before they had sunk a Russian
destroyer. A few days later the Russian battleship <i>Slava</i> was also
reported as having been sunk, while the balance of the Russian Baltic
fleet was trapped in the Gulf of Riga.</p>

<p>Amongst the French losses during September, 1917, was the steamer
<i>Media</i> of 4,770 tons, which was torpedoed late that month in the
western Mediterranean in spite of the fact that she was being convoyed
while in use as a transport. Of her crew of sixty-seven and of 559
soldiers on board 250 were reported missing.</p>

<p>Two fast German cruisers on October 17, 1917, attacked a convoy of
merchantmen, escorted by two British destroyers, at a point about
midway between the Shetland Islands and Norway. The two destroyers as
well as nine of the merchantmen were sunk with a total loss of about
250 lives.</p>

<p>On November 1, 1917, a German warship was reported to have been sunk
by a mine off the coast of Sweden. British naval forces, operating in
the Cattegat, on November 3, 1917, sank a German auxiliary cruiser and
ten German patrol vessels. On November 17, 1917, during an engagement
off Helgoland one German light cruiser was sunk and another damaged.</p>

<p>A German submarine, during November, 1917, attacked British naval
forces, cooperating with the British expeditionary force in Palestine
and sank one destroyer and one monitor.</p>

<p>On November 22, 1917, it was announced that the German Government had
included in its "barred zone" waters around the Azores and the channel
hitherto left open in the Mediterranean to reach Greece, and had
extended the limits of the zone around England.</p>

<p>On November 29, 1917, a German torpedo boat struck a mine off the
coast of Belgium and sank, all of her crew with the exception of two
being lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>(p. 259)</span> During the night of December 9-10, 1917, Italian naval forces
entered the harbor of Trieste and successfully torpedoed the Austrian
battleship <i>Wien</i>, which sank almost immediately.</p>

<p>A German submarine bombarded on December 12, 1917, for about twenty
minutes Funchal on the island of Madeira, destroying many houses and
killing and wounding many people.</p>

<p>On the same day German destroyers attacked a convoy of merchantmen in
the North Sea and sank six of them as well as a British destroyer and
four armed trawlers.</p>

<p>Two days later, December 14, 1917, the French cruiser <i>Château
Renault</i> was sunk in the Mediterranean by a submarine which itself was
destroyed later on.</p>

<p>During the night of December 22-23, 1917, three British destroyers
were lost off the Dutch coast with a total loss of lives of 193
officers and men. On December 30, 1917, the British transport <i>Aragon</i>
and a British destroyer, coming to her assistance, were torpedoed and
sunk. The following day, December 31, 1917, the auxiliary <i>Osmanieh</i>
struck a mine and sank. The total loss involved in these three
sinkings was 809 lives, of which forty-three were members of the crew
and officers, and 766 military officers and soldiers.</p>

<p>During the night of January 12, 1918, two British destroyers ran
ashore off the coast of Scotland. All hands were lost. Yarmouth was
bombarded on January 14, 1918, for five minutes by German naval forces
and four persons were killed and eight injured.</p>

<p>British naval forces fought an action at the entrance to the
Dardanelles on January 20, 1918. As a result the Turkish cruiser
<i>Midullu</i>, formerly the German cruiser <i>Breslau</i>, was sunk and the
battle cruiser <i>Sultan Selim</i>, formerly the <i>Goeben</i>, damaged and
beached. The British lost two monitors and, a week later, a submarine
which attempted to enter the Dardanelles in order to complete the
destruction of the <i>Goeben</i>.</p>

<p>On January 28, 1918, the British torpedo gunboat <i>Hazard</i> was lost as
the result of a collision. The day before the big Cunard liner
<i>Andania</i> of 13,405 tons was attacked off the Ulster coast. Her
passengers and crew were saved, the boat, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>(p. 260)</span> however, sank a few
days later. Another severe loss was the sinking of the British armed
boarding steamer <i>Louvain</i> in the Mediterranean with a loss of 224
lives on January 21, 1918.</p>

<p>Two German destroyers sank off the coast of Jutland during the same
week.</p>

<p>The United States Navy, during the six months' period covered in this
chapter, fared comparatively well, in spite of the fact that large
forces were engaged in patrol duty in European waters and many
transports crossed from the States to Europe and vice versa. Of the
latter only one was lost. On October 17, 1917, the <i>Antilles</i> while
returning to the United States was torpedoed and sunk. Of those on
board sixty-seven were drowned, including sixteen soldiers.</p>

<p>The United States destroyer <i>Cassin</i> had an encounter with a German
submarine on October 16, 1917. Though struck by a torpedo, she was not
seriously damaged and made port safely, after having first attempted,
until night broke, to discover her attacker, without succeeding,
however.</p>

<p>The patrol boat <i>Alcedo</i>, formerly a steam yacht, belonging to G. W.
C. Drexel of Philadelphia, was torpedoed and sunk on November 5, 1917.
She was the first fighting unit of the United States Navy to be lost
since the war begun. Two weeks later, on November 19, 1917, the United
States destroyer <i>Chancey</i> was sunk as a result of a collision,
twenty-one lives being lost.</p>

<p>On December 6, 1917, the United States destroyer <i>Jacob Jones</i> was
sunk by a U-boat and 60 lives were lost.</p>

<p class="title">THE WAR IN THE AIR</p>


<p>Aeroplanes, dirigible and other balloons are no longer considered
freaks and curiosities, as they were at the beginning of the war.
Their use has become an integral part of all military and most naval
operations. On all fronts they are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>(p. 261)</span> employed regularly and
extensively, just as any other branch of the military and naval
services. In considering, therefore, aerial operations at the various
fronts during the six months' period&mdash;August 1, 1917, to February 1,
1918&mdash;in this chapter we shall treat only of such undertakings in the
air which were carried out independent of the general military
operations. Those events in the air which formed part of offensive or
defensive actions have been mentioned in their proper place as part of
the general narrative. In this direction it must suffice to state here
that all forms of aerial activities were continuously carried on by
all belligerents at all fronts to even a greater extent than before.
Statistics as to losses of aeroplanes and of members of the various
flying services are very incomplete and more or less unreliable,
primarily because each side has been trying to keep the other in the
dark as to actual increases or decreases in the effectives of their
air service. Such figures as are available, however, will be given a
little farther on. They must not be taken as final, even though it has
been attempted to compile them with the utmost care.</p>

<p>As in the past, air warfare, independent of military operations,
consisted, of course, of German and Austrian attacks on French,
English, and Italian territory behind the actual front, and of similar
operations on the part of the French, English, Italian, and American
air services against German and Austrian territory.</p>

<p>As compared with previous performances, the Zeppelin attacks against
English and French territory decreased considerably in number, though
apparently not in effectiveness, except that the losses suffered by
the attackers were much heavier as a result of improved conditions in
aerial defense. There were only two raids over England and none over
France. The first Zeppelin raid over England occurred on August 21,
1917. It was directed against the Yorkshire coast, caused little
damage and killed one man. On the same day British aeroplanes brought
down one of the monster airships off the Danish coast.</p>

<p>During the night of October 19-20, 1917, thirteen Zeppelins raided the
eastern and northeastern counties of England. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>(p. 262)</span> Thirty-four
persons were killed and fifty-six injured. On their return journey
they were attacked by French airmen and it was announced later that
four were destroyed and three captured. Amongst the latter, one, the
L-49, was brought down intact, the first one to be captured in this
manner since the war had begun.</p>

<p>Figures regarding Germany's Zeppelin strength and losses are, of
course, hard to obtain. From German sources there are none. But at the
end of 1917, French and English authorities semiofficially published
the following data:</p>

<p>Though Zeppelins apparently had practically reached the end of their
usefulness, a considerable increase took place in the number and
extent of aeroplane raids, especially over England.</p>

<p>A number of watering places on the southeast coast of England were
raided on August 12, 1917. Twenty-five persons were killed, fifty-two
injured, and two German machines were brought down. Dover, Margate,
and Ramsgate were visited on August 22, 1917, killing eleven persons
and injuring thirteen. Eight of the attacking machines failed to
return home.</p>

<p>The east coast was again raided on September 2, 1917. The following
day, September 3, 1917, an English naval station at Chatham, near
London, was bombed. One hundred and eight persons were killed and
ninety-two wounded, most of them members of the English naval service.
The first moonlight raid of London was carried out during the night of
September 4-5, 1917. It resulted in the death of eleven persons and in
the wounding of sixty-two.</p>

<p class="smcap">Five zeppelins destroyed after the air raid on London,
October 19-20, 1917.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>(p. 264)</span> The end of September, 1917, brought a large number of raids
on England. On the 24th the southeast coast and the London district
were raided. Fifteen were killed and seventy injured. Again on the
25th German machines appeared over London, killing seven and wounding
twenty-six. On September 29, 1917, another raid killed eleven and
wounded eighty-two; two of the attacking machines being brought down.
The next night machines again were over England, killing nine persons.</p>

<p>One of the strongest air attacks was carried out on October 1, 1917.
Four German squadrons attacked a number of coast towns, ten persons
were killed and thirty-eight wounded. The next raid occurred on
October 31, 1917. There were thirty German machines, but only three
succeeded in reaching London. Eight persons were killed and twenty-one
wounded.</p>

<p>Twenty-five German machines broke through the English air defenses and
reached London on December 6, 1917. Two of them were brought down,
not, however, until they had killed seven persons and injured
twenty-one. Other raids occurred on December 18 and 21, 1917. Each
time a number of the German machines were brought down. Ten persons
were killed and seventy were injured.</p>

<p>Both on January 28 and 29, 1918, German squadrons attacked England,
bombing the Kent and Essex coasts and London. A total of sixty-eight
were killed and 183 were wounded. During the night of January 30-31,
1918, Paris experienced its first aerial attack since many a day. The
casualties were forty-five killed and 207 wounded.</p>

<p>Besides these attacks by German machines against England and Paris,
there were also incessant raids on French cities near the front.
Dunkirk, Calais, Boulogne, Nancy, Belfort, and many other towns
suffered especially.</p>

<p>On the other hand both the English and French air service were very
active. Frequent attacks were made on French and Belgian cities held
by the Germans, especially on Lille, Bruges, Ostende, and Zeebrugge.
Some of the near-by German cities, such as Metz, too, were frequently
attacked. German airdromes <span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>(p. 265)</span> also were subjected to continuous
attacks, hampering German operations to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>In retaliation for the German attacks on English cities, both French
and British air squadrons made many successful raids on German inland
cities. Few details are available regarding these raids, however, the
German Government having adopted a policy of more or less silence
concerning the results achieved. Amongst the German cities attacked
were especially: Colmar, Frankfort-on-Main, Freiburg, Stuttgart,
Tübingen, Saarbrücken, Lahr, Mannheim, Rastatt, Ludwigshafen,
Thionville, Trèves, Pirmasens, Kaiserslautern, Karlsruhe.</p>

<p>On the Italian front, too, there was greater aerial activity than
ever. Pola, the Austrian naval base in the Adriatic, south of Trieste,
was the chief aim of the Italian attacks, in which British airmen,
having come to the support of the Italians, frequently participated.
It was visited many times and much damage was done, both to ships and
naval establishments. Trieste, too, was bombarded a number of times
with good results.</p>

<p>The Austro-German air services made a number of attacks against
Italian cities back of the front. Venice was one of the chief
sufferers. The first attack occurred on August 14, 1917. Unfortunately
many of these raids on Italian cities resulted in serious damages to
churches, palaces, and other monuments of historic fame and value.
Another attack against Venice was made on September 7, 1917. Again on
November 25, 1917, Austrian or German airplanes bombed the ancient
city of the Doges.</p>

<p>In December, 1917, Padua, not very far from the New Austro-Italian
front, was the principal recipient of Austrian attentions. It was
bombed on December 28, 30, and 31, 1917. About twenty persons were
killed and some seventy wounded. Considerable damage was done to the
cathedral, many other churches and numerous houses.</p>

<p>During the first few days of January, 1918, Vicenza, Bassano, Treviso,
and Padua were bombed, almost continuously. About fifteen persons were
killed, and fifty wounded and great <span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>(p. 266)</span> damage was done to some
of the wonderful old churches and palaces in these towns. During the
night of January 26, 1918, Treviso and Mestre were bombed. In the
latter city two Americans, William Platt and R. C. Fairfield, attached
to the American Red Cross, were killed.</p>

<p>Figures regarding losses of the various air services were growing
continuously more scarce and unreliable, a considerable amount of
secrecy being imposed on all sides for military reasons.</p>

<p>In August the Germans claimed that during July, 1917, they had brought
down 213 Allied aeroplanes and twenty-four balloons, but had lost only
sixty machines themselves. From this source it was claimed that during
August, 1917, the Germans lost sixty-four against 295 Allied machines,
and that during December, 1917, the corresponding figures were
eighty-two and 119.</p>

<p>The only official announcement regarding losses suffered by the German
air services was made by the French authorities, who claimed that
French airmen had accomplished the following results against the
Germans:</p>

<p>For the period January to December 15, 1917, French airmen claimed the
following figures, brought down in German and French lines: 586
machines; seriously damaged, 583. In practically the same period in
1916 (January-December 31) the corresponding figures had been only 417
and 185.</p>

<p>Some interesting figures also were published from combined English and
French calculations regarding the strength of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>(p. 267)</span> German air
service at the end of 1917. It was claimed that it consisted of more
than 200 squadrons with a total of about 2,500 machines, divided as
follows:</p>

<p>There were also said to be numerous separate squadrons of aeroplanes
and hydroplanes belonging to the German Navy, and about twelve
squadrons each for garrison and training purposes.</p>

<p>Amongst other events in the various aerial services a number deserve
especial mention. On September 7, 1917, German machines bombed a
number of Allied hospitals on the French coast. As a result four
Americans, belonging to a Harvard unit, were killed and ten wounded,
and another American, a member of a St. Louis, Mo., unit, was killed.</p>

<p>On September 11, 1917, the famous French "ace," Captain Georges
Guynemer, was killed in an air battle, after having brought down
shortly before his 53d enemy plane.</p>

<p>On November 22, 1917, the British Admiralty announced that a
successful air attack in the vicinity of Constantinople had been
carried out by a large British bombing airplane, which flew from
England to a British base in the Mediterranean in a series of eight
flights. The stopping places included Lyons and Rome, and the total
distance covered was nearly 2,000 miles. The machine was actually in
the air thirty-one hours. This is believed to be a world's record for
a cross-country journey and for the weight carried. During some parts
of the flight strong winds and heavy rainstorms were experienced, and
there was one stretch of 200 miles over a mountainous country where it
would be impossible for any machine to land.</p>

<p>Another record long-distance flight was that made by Captain Laureati
of the Italian air service in a S. T. A. machine with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>(p. 268)</span> a 200
H. P. Fiat engine, from Turin to London, a distance of 650 miles. The
distance was covered in seven hours, twenty-two minutes, and thirty
seconds. No stops were made and one passenger, a mechanician, was
carried.</p>

<p>In the latter part of January, 1918, the former German cruiser
<i>Goeben</i>, then the Turkish <i>Sultan Selim</i>, having been beached after a
fight with British naval forces at the entrance to the Dardanelles was
bombed repeatedly by British naval aviators who also bombed
Constantinople with success.</p>

<p>As a result of a raid, carried out during the latter part of August,
1917, a member of the famous Lafayette Squadron, Corporal H. B.
Willis, Harvard '17, was captured by the Germans after his plane had
been shot down behind the German lines.</p>

<p>Another member, Sergeant Douglas MacMonagle of San Francisco, who had
joined the Lafayette Squadron in June, 1917, and had received the
French war cross on August 9, 1917, was killed in a fight on September
24, 1917.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269"></a>(p. 269)</span> PART VIII&mdash;THE WESTERN FRONT</h2>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<p class="title">PREPARING FOR THE GREAT OFFENSIVE&mdash;THE ATTACK MARCH 21&mdash;FIRST PHASE OF
THE BATTLE</p>


<p>With the coming of bright, springlike weather on the western front in
the first weeks of February, 1918, the contending forces displayed a
new activity. The sodden fields were drying out; the snow and mud
which made roads impassable had disappeared. If the fine weather
continued to hold, the much advertised German offensive could not be
long delayed.</p>

<p>The Allies were constantly engaged in trench raids for the main
purpose of gaining information from prisoners as to the movements of
the enemy. It was learned that the Germans were making intense
preparations for a big operation. Fresh troops and many guns were
constantly arriving on the front. Certain back areas were being
cleared for action. Every day large bodies of troops were practicing
attacks under the tutelage of experts.</p>

<p>The Allies meanwhile awaited the promised blow hopefully if not
calmly. As far as could be ascertained they had a preponderance of men
and guns, and the most elaborate preparations had been made during the
winter months for the anticipated offensive.</p>

<p>But the much heralded "great push" did not start in February. The
Germans were cautiously "feeling out" the ground, by means of trench
raids and bombardments, and gathering information through their aerial
observers regarding the disposition of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>(p. 270)</span> Allied forces,
while the intense activity which prevailed within their own lines
foreshadowed the nearness of a mighty attack, and what might prove to
be the most sanguinary period of the war.</p>

<p>During the first days of March the Germans were engaged daily in raids
all along the French and British fronts, but in every attempt they
were repulsed with considerable losses. Determined efforts were made
by the enemy to obtain possession of Fort La Pompelle to the southeast
of Rheims, which would give them a dominating position from which to
complete the destruction of that martyred city. Along a front of
nearly ten miles extending from Loivre to Sillery the German infantry
advanced from five different points. Some troops succeeded in reaching
Alger Farm, a fortified position fronting on Fort La Pompelle, but
none was able to enter the fort itself.</p>

<p>The French regiment holding the position in a spirited counterattack
drove the Germans back, and regained every inch of ground, though
bombarded by thousands of gas shells which filled the air with
poisonous fumes. It was during this bombardment that a number of
French prisoners escaped their captors and sought refuge in a shell
crater where they discovered a large supply of hand grenades. With
these they were able to hold off the enemy who tried to capture them
and after killing a number succeeded in regaining their own lines.</p>

<p>On March 6, 1918, the Germans made a strong attack on Belgian
positions in the flooded zone northwest of Dixmude. At daybreak
Beverdyk and Reigersvliet were bombarded by explosives and gas shells
and an infantry attack in force followed.</p>

<p>The Belgian artillery replied with a heavy barrage and the fine work
of their gunners and riflemen checked the German advance at Beverdyk
and eventually drove them back to their own lines. At Reigersvliet the
Germans won a footing at several points owing to the fact that the
floods in some places had largely subsided, and made an advance
comparatively easy.</p>

<p class="smcap">The German offensive from Arras to the Oise,
March-June, 1918.</p>
</div>

<p>It was here that a Belgian commander with only nine men and a machine
gun, and occupying a bridgehead, held back hundreds of Germans and
twelve machine guns until a patrol <span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>(p. 272)</span> arrived. With this slight
reenforcement the Belgian officer took the offensive and by a dashing
attack recaptured the position which the Germans had won in front of
the bridgehead. Belgian chasseurs had meanwhile been organizing for a
counterattack. To reach the German positions it was necessary to cross
the flooded area by a single plank walk which was completely dominated
by German artillery and machine-gun fire. But the Belgians went
forward as coolly as if on parade amid a tempest of shells, and
attacked the invaders with reckless bravery. Close and sanguinary
fighting ensued, but by 1 o'clock in the afternoon the Belgians had
succeeded in capturing the first of seven posts which lay in a
semicircle in front of the bridgehead. For hours the fighting raged
back and forth, but the stubborn German resistance broke down before
the flaming fury of the Belgian spirit and late in the afternoon the
last post was regained from the enemy. The German losses were heavy.
Large numbers were found dead on the barbed wire. Belgian gunnery had
been remarkably effective. The Germans lost as prisoners five
officers, 111 men, and a dozen machine guns.</p>

<p>On March 8, 1918, after a bombardment that lasted all day, the Germans
launched an attack on the British lines on a front of nearly a mile
from south of the Menin road to north of the Polderhoek Château. The
assault was vigorously pressed, aided by intense artillery fire, but
the Germans were driven back at all points except in the neighborhood
of Polderhoek, where they penetrated British advanced posts on a front
of about 200 yards. Here the fighting continued for the greater part
of the night, with the result that the British recaptured all the
positions they had lost.</p>

<p>In the first ten days of March the Germans made twenty hard-driven
raids along the French front, most of which were repulsed without
difficulty. In the region of the Butte-du-Mesnil they regained some
trenches which the French had won from them in February.</p>

<p>The British on their front continued to hold the initiative, carrying
out successfully minor operations along the Ypres salient as well as
at many points south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span> The Germans continued to make swift dashes into the British
lines at a number of points. As subsequently developed, the purpose of
these continued raids was to search out the weak spots in the British
defense. During two successive nights the Germans undertook no less
than ten minor operations along the British front, some of which were
of more importance than mere raids.</p>

<p>In the midst of this continued activity the great offensive was not
forgotten. It was a period of great tension for the Allied forces, and
more than once there were rumors that the great push had started, and
no-man's-land was deluged with shells and the night was bright with
star shells and illuminants, to be followed by comparative calm only
broken by raids and minor operations.</p>

<p>As described in another place, the American troops took an active part
in many of these minor engagements which tried their courage and
served as excellent schooling in the art of active warfare.</p>

<p>At 8 a. m. on March 21, 1918, the Germans launched the great offensive
on a front of over fifty miles extending from the river Oise in the
neighborhood of La Fère to the Sensée River about Croisilles. When the
attack was made the position of the Allied armies was as follows: The
British Fifth Army under General Sir Hubert Gough held the front from
the Oise at La Fère to a point north of the Omignon River, where the
defense line was taken up by the Third Army under General Sir Julian
Byng, whose left rested on the Scarpe River, joining here the First
Army under General Sir Henry Horne. Sixteen divisions held this line
of about 100,000 yards, which gave to each division (9,000 rifles)
about 6,000 yards.</p>

<p>Facing the British were three German armies. The Seventh, under
General Otto von Below, on the right held the front from north of the
Scarpe to the Scheldt at Cambrai where General von der Marwitz with
the Second Army prolonged the line down to north of St. Quentin.
General von Hutier, commanding the Eighth Army, held the line on
Marwitz's left between Omignon River and the Oise, where an army under
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>(p. 274)</span> General Böhm faced the Third French Army under General
Humbert.</p>

<p>The German offensive had been prepared with the greatest care; every
division had rehearsed the part it was to play when the hour of attack
should come. Before the push the British lines were deluged with
shells, and this was followed by showers of projectiles that liberated
poisonous gases. The infantry now went forward in waves following each
other closely. The first wave of troops would be swept almost away by
the British gun and rifle fire, but those that remained alive hung on
until joined by more waves of men, when using flame projectors they
proceeded to drive the British out of the trenches.</p>

<p>The Germans were prodigal in the waste of man power, counting on
weight of numbers to crush their opponents. After they had captured
the first British line, the rear lines were deluged with fire from the
machine guns, rifles, and every form of small artillery. This
overpowering avalanche of death-dealing projectiles prevented the
British in the rear from coming to the rescue of their fellow soldiers
in the first line. Under the protection of this storm of bullets the
Germans advancing in waves penetrated the British second line. After
they had gone some distance the first ranks of infantry lay down, and
permitted other waves of men to pass through their ranks. Great
numbers of three-inch guns and small cannon on low carriages that
could be swiftly moved were now brought up behind the infantry and
the attack went on.</p>

<p>The German attack was directed against the center of the Allies'
position. Their aim was to drive a great salient on a front of fifty
or sixty miles through the occupied lines which would divide the
French and British, after which they were to be dealt with separately.</p>

<p>The German objective was Amiens, which, situated astride the Somme, is
on the main trunk-line railroad from Paris to the Channel ports of
Boulogne and Calais, the most important strategical point in northern
France.</p>

<p>If the Germans succeeded in gaining their objective, Sir Douglas
Haig's troops separated from their French allies would <span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>(p. 275)</span> be
penned up in a northwestern corner of France with their backs to the
sea, or they would be forced to retreat behind the lower Somme in
order to cover their communications with Havre.</p>

<p>The Germans began their great offensive by an intense bombardment of
both high explosives and gas shells, while a powerful infantry attack
was launched on a front extending from Croisilles to La Fère. The
misty weather that prevailed in the morning of March 21, 1918, was
favorable for an assault, and the Germans were close to the British
lines before they were discovered. In the course of the first onrush
they broke through all the British outpost trenches and south of
Cambrai penetrated some battle positions.</p>

<p>Forty German divisions were identified by the British as taking part
in the first day's attack, but it was believed that at least fifty in
all entered the battle before the day closed. At several points the
British were heavily outnumbered. Nine German divisions were hurled
against three British at one part of the line and eight against two at
another.</p>

<p>The German storming troops, including the Guards, made a brave
appearance in new uniforms. They advanced in solid ranks until their
formation was broken by the intense British machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>Over the dead and wounded the supporting troops swept in countless
waves and there was no faltering as the hurricanes of shells swept
through their ranks. As hundreds fell others closed in and filled the
gaps and the human tide rolled relentlessly on.</p>

<p>The Germans were exceedingly strong in guns. At some points in the
line they had one to every twelve or fifteen yards. No less than a
thousand confronted three British divisions. With heavy long-range
guns they were also well provided and back areas to a distance of
twenty-five miles and more were under shell fire.</p>

<p>Among the places against which the Germans first directed their
efforts were Bullecourt, Lagnecourt, and Noreuil west of Cambrai, the
St. Quentin Ridge on the right of the Cambrai <span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>(p. 276)</span> salient, and
Ronssoy and Hargicourt south of the Cambrai salient.</p>

<p>The Germans reported that they had captured the British first line
between Arras and La Fère and 16,000 prisoners and 200 guns.</p>

<p>On the following day (March 22, 1918,) the fighting reached the
greatest intensity in two sectors&mdash;one north of Cambrai and the other
southwest. The fighting on the northern front was about Bullecourt,
while Hargicourt was the southern center. Before attacking the sector
between the Canal du Nord and Croisilles the Germans for four hours
deluged the British with every kind of projectile and high explosive
that a gun could throw.</p>

<p>The British were compelled to fight for hours with their gas masks on,
but despite this drawback they were in high spirits because they were
able to create such havoc when the Germans advanced in massed
formation.</p>

<p>Around Mory on the northern end of the battle field the Germans
attacked with superior numbers and the fighting was especially fierce.
The British held on during the day, but toward evening the Germans
gained a foothold in the village after close fighting that lasted some
hours. The Germans advanced for this attack from Croisilles and for a
long time were held back by a company of British gunners who were
stationed on high ground, from which point of vantage they mowed down
the enemy with a grilling fire.</p>

<p>The most critical period for the Allies since the offensive was
launched was in the afternoon and the night of March 22-23, 1918, when
the British lost important positions one after another as German
divisions in successive masses carried everything before them,
regardless of losses. General Gough's Fifth Army especially suffered,
being hit by Von der Marwitz on the north, and Von Hutier on the east.
Under these sustained hammer blows the entire front gave way and the
British were forced to retire across the Somme, pursued by Generals
Lüttwitz and Öttingen. Lower down Generals Webern and Von Conta, with
troops of the Seventh Army under Von Gayl, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>(p. 277)</span> captured Ham, and
forced the French who had crossed the Oise back to Chauny.</p>

<p>This was the blackest hour for the Allies. Von Hutier had rolled up
the British right wing. The road to Paris down the Oise was no longer
a doubtful adventure. Unless the broken link between the French and
British could be restored the Germans had accomplished what they set
out to do.</p>

<p>In this crucial hour for the Allies, when the demoralization of the
Fifth British Army was complete, General Carey with a scratch division
kept it in touch with General Byng's Third Army on the north over an
eight-mile gap, and the French General Fayolle saved it in the south
over a thirty-mile gap between it and the Sixth French Army.</p>

<p>As the result of the first two days' fighting the Germans claimed to
have captured 25,000 prisoners, 400 guns, and 300 machine guns. It was
also claimed that between Fontaine-les-Croisilles and M&oelig;uvers
German forces had penetrated into the second British positions and
captured Vaulx-Vraucourt and Morches, the former being about three and
a half miles, and the latter two and a half miles, behind the former
British front. It was further claimed by the Germans that the British
after evacuating their positions in the bend southwest of Cambrai were
pursued through Demicourt, Flesquières and Ribecourt. Between
Gonnelieu and the Omignon stream the first two British positions were
penetrated and the heights west of Gouzeaucourt, Heudicourt, and
Villers-Faucon were captured.</p>

<p>The German official report stated that the battle of attack against
the British front was under command of the kaiser.</p>

<p>The Germans sprung a new form of frightfulness on the Allies when at 8
o'clock in the morning of March 23, 1918, they bombarded Paris with
long-range guns. At intervals of about twenty minutes shells of 240
millimeters (about 9.5 inches) reached the capital, killing ten
persons and wounding others. The shortest distance from Paris to the
front was over sixty-two miles. The first daylight aeroplane raid
followed this bombardment, but did little damage. Public interest was
centered on the mysterious gun that could drop shells on the city from
such a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>(p. 278)</span> great distance. Pieces of shells examined were found
to bear rifling marks showing that they had not been dropped, but were
fired from some kind of gun. Later the French located several of these
"mystery guns," and some were destroyed. The only purpose they could
serve was to terrify the people of Paris, otherwise they were of no
military importance.</p>

<p>While the British front was being overrun by the German hordes the
French front was subjected to violent artillery fire, especially south
of the Oise in the Rheims region, in Lorraine, between Harracourt and
the Vosges mountains and the heights of Alsace. The Germans made only
one attack on the French lines in the region of Blemeray, where they
were dispersed with considerable losses in dead and prisoners.</p>

<p>South and north of Péronne the Germans renewed their attacks on the
British front throughout the day of March 24, 1918. South of the city
they succeeded after heavy fighting in crossing the Somme at some
points.</p>

<p>North of Péronne violent attacks were directed against the line of the
Tortille River (a tributary of the Somme), where the British were
finally forced to withdraw to new positions. Although fighting
continued at different points during the night, the situation had not
changed. British troops held the line of the Somme River to Péronne.
German troops that attempted to cross the river at Pargny were driven
back. The British right was now in touch with the French, and
continued to hold their positions to the north of the Somme at Péronne
after beating off a number of attacks made by the Germans on this
front during the early hours of the night.</p>

<p>The Allies, despite considerable losses and the yielding of some miles
of territory, were undismayed. The Germans had not attained their
objectives at any point. Hard fighting was still in progress, but the
British were holding strongly the whole front line to which they had
withdrawn. The British had used only a few troops besides those that
held the front lines. The brave defense maintained by these shock
troops enabled the British main body to fall back on the positions
they had established a long time before the German offensive was
started.</p>

<p class="smcap">The range of the German 80-mile gun.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>(p. 280)</span> Owing to the German methods of advancing in dense masses
their losses had been terrific. The British identified fifty German
divisions that had been hurled into the sea of fire made by the Allied
artillery, machine guns, and rifles. The British losses were
considerable, but principally in prisoners. They also lost a number of
guns, but very few pieces of artillery were captured by the Germans
after the first day of the offensive.</p>

<p>The hardest fighting on March 25, 1918, was around Bapaume. The
British artillery on the heights west of the town broke up every
attack which the Germans launched. Later in the day the British were
forced to withdraw to the west, leaving the town in enemy hands. On
the following day the Germans renewed their attacks, but by afternoon
these had ceased, and the British took advantage of the comparative
calm to retire in good order to their old positions behind the Ancre
which they held in July, 1916, when the battle of the Somme began.</p>

<p>The Germans began their attacks on the Allied front south of the Somme
early in the morning of March 26, 1918, and about 10.30 had captured
Roye. West of this place and Noyon the British, French, and American
troops held the enemy in check. Fresh German divisions brought forward
pressed the attack all along the Somme. The assaults around Chaulnes
and on the front northward from there to Bray were especially
violent. The German troops displayed a reckless bravery in these
attacks and were heavily punished. Their losses were so considerable
that reenforcements were brought up from all parts of the western
front. It was established by the British that more than seventy
divisions (about 840,000) men were engaged.</p>

<p>The net results to the Germans during the seven days' fighting may be
briefly summed up as follows: They had won back most of the line they
lost when retreating from the Somme line of 1916 on the fifty-mile
front between the Oise and the Scarpe and this stretch of territory is
from twenty to twenty-five miles wide along about forty miles of
front. Though the Germans had failed to gain all their objectives and
the offensive had not proved as successful as they hoped for, the
Allies were not disposed to minimize the seriousness of the situation.
They found <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>(p. 281)</span> comfort in the fact that in the seven days'
fighting the British who had borne the brunt of the blows had lost in
killed, wounded, and missing not more than 100,000 men while the
German losses were nearly 600,000. It was also believed that at least
one half of the remaining German troops had reached such a point of
exhaustion that they could no longer do effective fighting. At the
close of the seven days' struggle the battle line took in Fenchy,
Boyelles, Hebuterne, Albert, Chapilly, Bray-sur-Somme, Avre, and
Noyon.</p>

<p>After an all-day battle north and south of the Somme, with Arras as
the chief center, the British forces beat off the Germans, inflicting
heavy losses. The attack on this new sector, delivered on a wide front
north and south of the river Scarpe, was opened with an intense
bombardment, and under cover of smoke clouds. The Germans were unable
to break or even bend the British front and they lost a large number
in killed and prisoners. South of the Somme, the British, subjected to
fierce assaults, maintained their positions throughout the day, but
the Germans brought forward fresh troops, and by sheer weight of
numbers forced the British about nightfall to fall back on Chapilly.
North of the Somme the British maintained their line intact.</p>

<p>On the same day the French made substantial gains on the front from
Lassigny to Noyon, advancing their line about ten kilometers (6.21
miles) to a depth of about a mile and a quarter. During the entire
morning the Germans pressed vigorous assaults in the region of
Montdidier in attempts to enlarge their gains west and south of the
town. The French troops in spirited counterattacks drove the Germans
out of the village of Courtemanche, Mesnil-St. Georges, and
Assainvillers, and proceeded to occupy these places solidly.</p>

<p>On the following day fresh German troops were thrown against the
French Army maintaining the junction between the French and British
lines. The French made a determined stand, but the German pressure
forced them to retire toward the west. The Germans broke through at
Montdidier and occupied that place. In order to keep in touch with the
British the French <span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>(p. 282)</span> were pushing northward to relieve part of
the line of their ally which had been thrown back. At the same time
the Germans made a demonstration at the point where the British and
French lines joined. Employing large forces, they were able to make a
breach in the British line, but the French sent forward cavalry and
infantry into the gap and closed it.</p>

<p>The salient which the Germans had now been pushing westward since the
beginning of the offensive was now forty miles long at its farthest
point, from Vimy Ridge, three miles south of Arras, to two miles south
of Lassigny. Its greatest width was thirty miles, from the old line
west of La Fère westward to Montdidier, the junction of the new
western and southern fronts. On the north the territory was flanked by
a semicircular ridge lying north and northeast of Arras, beginning
with Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, six miles southwest of Lens, and ending at
the much-fought-over Vimy Ridge.</p>

<p>The base of the German salient ran from Montdidier east and a little
south, by way of Noyon, and linked up with the old line between St.
Gobain and Anizy-le-Château, nine miles west of Laon, a distance of
thirty-two miles in all. Just as the northern extremity of the German
salient was flanked by the Arras ridges, so the southern extremity of
thirty-two miles was flanked in the east by the watershed of the Oise
and the Aisne, and eastward from the valley of the Oise, where it is
joined by the ridge lying parallel to the Chiry-Lassigny highway.</p>

<p>The Allies holding the ridges north and south of the German salient
were in a favorable position, and it seemed unlikely that the Germans
would attempt to push farther westward without trying to capture the
high approaches on their flanks.</p>

<p>It was known to the Allies through their aerial observers that the
German armies, reenforced by new divisions that had been brought from
Russia, were massing for another powerful attack.</p>

<p>On March 28, 1918, strong German forces drove back the British line
south of the Somme to a line running west of Hamel, Marcelcave, and
Demuin in the direction of Amiens. On the same date the Germans
launched a terrific drive in the Scarpe sector with the purpose of
capturing Arras and Vimy Ridge. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>(p. 283)</span> Six German divisions were
flung against the British positions, while four were held in reserve,
but they failed to break through. To the south between Boiry and Serre
eleven divisions attacked the British positions, but were forced back.</p>

<p>On the same date, in the Montdidier region, the French under Pétain
not only held their ground but made gains. In the course of the
evening and part of the night the Germans made violent attacks in the
endeavor to eject the French from the villages of Courtemanche,
Mesnil-St. Georges, and Assainvillers, which were won the day before,
but in every instance were driven back with heavy losses. The French
followed up their success by driving the enemy out of Monchel, which
they occupied.</p>

<p>To the north of Montdidier Franco-British troops continued to hold the
Germans on the Avre River and in front of Neuville, Mezières,
Marcelcave, and Hamel.</p>

<p>It was evident that the great German offensive was losing force. The
fighting was still intense at some points, but no operations were
attempted on such a colossal scale as marked the fighting in the first
week of the battle. At many places along the front of attack the
Germans were being driven back and at others French and British were
holding their positions firmly. Artillery battles had now taken the
place of infantry fighting to a great extent, a sure sign that the
German armies were in an exhausted condition and needed time to
re-form and recuperate. As the Germans had been unable to drag much
artillery with them during their advance the French had the advantage.</p>

<p>On March 28, 1918, the news that General Ferdinand Foch, chief of the
French General Staff had been made generalissimo of all the Allied
forces in the western theater of war was received with general
satisfaction by the Allied nations. The Allies had long suffered from
lack of coordination, while the Germans had not only profited by their
own united direction, but were also advantaged by the frequently
unrelated efforts of their enemies. General Foch, who was born in
1851, began mastering the strategy of war in 1870. He had studied
German mentality. He counted on their repeating in future conflicts
the maneuvers <span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>(p. 284)</span> that had succeeded, and also expected them to
make some of the old mistakes. Foch led the Ninth French Army at the
Battle of the Marne, where, according to some military critics, he won
first honors. In the spring of 1915 he led his army in the offensive
between Armentières and Arras. After these operations he was surpassed
in public opinion of the French army chiefs by Generals Pétain and
Nivelle, whose wonderful leadership before Verdun made them famous
throughout the world. When General Pétain succeeded Nivelle in May,
1917, as commander in chief in the field, General Foch took his place
as chief of staff in Paris. President Wilson, who had been urging
unify of command ever since the inter-Ally war conference at Paris in
the winter of 1917, was among the first to congratulate General Foch
on his appointment as generalissimo of all the Allied forces on the
western front.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<p class="title">THE SECOND PHASE OF THE GREAT GERMAN OFFENSIVE</p>


<p>The full force of the great German offensive having spent itself,
though fighting still continued, it may be of great interest to
consider how far the Germans succeeded in carrying out their carefully
laid plans.</p>

<p>It was evident that their main purpose was not to capture Paris or
reach the Channel ports, though these objectives were considered, but
to destroy either the French or the British army. The British being
the most powerful of the Allies' armies, owing to conditions that
developed after the offensive started, was made the object of the
Germans' most determined destructive efforts. They planned to strike a
mighty blow along the Oise between St. Quentin and La Fère, at the
junction of the French and British troops. Their purpose was to break
through at this point regardless of the cost. This accomplished, they
would push on up the Oise valley, and by throwing large forces
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>(p. 285)</span> across the British right turn it and roll it up. To
accomplish this it would be also necessary to destroy the British
salient at Cambrai, for unless this was done an advance down the Somme
would have left the whole German flank exposed to attack from the
north.</p>

<p>The first German attack was launched against the Cambrai salient from
the north and the east, and was successful as the British were driven
back.</p>

<p>In this preliminary assault the Germans employed some ninety divisions
or over 750,000 men on a front of about fifty miles. This was the
heaviest concentration of men to the mile that had so far been used in
campaigns on the western front. Against these forces the British had
only about 5,000 men to the mile or less than a third of the number
the Germans had in action. Having disposed of the Cambrai salient the
Germans had opened the way for the real attack south which was made in
the angle between the Oise Canal and the Somme. The assault was
carried out with great masses of men in close formation, and the
Allies' lines were overwhelmed in the first rush. But the British and
French made an orderly if hurried retreat and their front remained
unbroken. The Allies made the Germans pay heavily for every gain,
fighting on steadily from point to point. The British during the
retreat still clung to the southern bank of the Oise, but were
finally forced across the river at Noyon which fell to the Germans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the north the British were slowly falling back on the old
battle field of the Somme. It was wisely decided by the British High
Command to retire rather than bring forward the strong armies they
held in reserve back of the lines. The use of these armies would
eliminate the possibility of a great counterattack. Having reached the
old battle field and after the Ancre valley was passed, the British
ceased to retreat and established themselves strongly on the west bank
of the river.</p>

<p>South of the town of Albert the Germans made more important gains.
They had reached and passed the Allies' old line as it existed before
the fighting on the Somme. But in the last days of March they made
little progress as their artillery had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>(p. 286)</span> not kept pace with the
forward rush and until the guns arrived no important advance could be
made.</p>

<p>The French had halted behind the Avre River, an excellent position,
for there were wide marsh belts lining either bank of the stream.
Before the French ceased to retreat the Germans had pushed their
advance westward and encircled Montdidier, producing by doing this a
salient in their lines with the town as the apex. One German flank
extended eastward through Lassigny to the Oise and the other along the
Avre and behind it. This salient marked almost the extreme limit of
the German push.</p>

<p>North of the Somme and south of Arras the German advance was checked,
because the British held such strong positions on Vimy Ridge and the
heights of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. The Germans could not push on north
of the river before they had reduced these strong and commanding
positions. To clear the way they made a determined attack with 90,000
men on a small front of not more than five miles east of Arras. After
an intense artillery fire that lasted all day the Germans repeatedly
attacked, but met with repulse. They gained a few hundred yards at
several points, but the British line remained practically intact.</p>

<p>The net results of the German offensive showed that they had overrun
considerable territory and were some miles nearer Paris. But they had
not succeeded in crushing either the French or the British armies,
and the real question in the war was the destruction of forces.
Territorial gains were only of value as far as they contributed to
that end. There was not the least doubt that the Germans had lost a
far greater number of men than the Allies and that they could not
continue for long a campaign on such a costly scale. Unless they found
some other way out they were heading straight for defeat even if they
should succeed in overrunning the greater part of France.</p>

</div>

<p>In the last two days of March the Germans resumed heavy fighting in
the region between the Somme and the Avre and southward to Montdidier.
Six villages around Montdidier were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>(p. 287)</span> wrested from the
French&mdash;Ayencourt and Le Monchel south of the town, Mesnil-St.
Georges, Cantigny, Aubevillers and Grivesnes. On the following evening
the French recaptured Ayencourt and Le Monchel, a hundred prisoners,
and fourteen machine guns.</p>

<p>On the Oise front German detachments, consisting of a battalion of
storming troops, having succeeded in crossing the river at Chauny,
attempted to establish a bridgehead on the left bank. The French
launched a swift and vigorously pressed counterattack, with the result
that the German battalion was completely annihilated, or taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>Between Montdidier and Moreuil there was stiff fighting during the
last two days of March. The Germans repeatedly attacked almost without
ceasing. Moreuil, captured by them, was retaken by the French, again
taken by the Germans, and finally carried in a brilliant bayonet
charge by British and French troops. Between Moreuil and Lassigny the
German check was complete. The French also advanced as far as the
vicinity of Canny-sur-Matz. A division of picked French troops after a
hot fight in which they took over 700 prisoners captured Plemon and
held it firmly against repeated attempts made by the enemy to oust
them.</p>

<p>On the British front the Germans were especially active. Attacks
followed one another at different points unceasingly during March
30-31, 1918. All these assaults were costly and failed. The Germans'
determined efforts were unsuccessful elsewhere, for they lost
considerable ground near Feuchy, four miles east of Arras; and near
Serre, seven miles north of Albert, the British made a notable
advance, capturing 230 prisoners and forty machine guns. South of the
Somme, by successful counterattacks, the British regained possession
of the village of Demuin. There was heavy fighting in the sector to
the south of the main highway leading from Péronne to Amiens, which
proved costly to the Germans and brought no adequate returns.</p>

<p>At the close of the month it was the opinion of the French and British
High Command that the offensive for the present was checked. The
Germans were making strenuous efforts to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>(p. 288)</span> rush forward their
heavy artillery, and a formidable attack might be expected with all
the reserves available, but the Allies viewed the future with
confidence. At the same time they looked for a long struggle which
might develop into such a contest as was fought at Verdun and the
first battle of the Somme.</p>

<p>April 1, 1918, showed a slackening in the German pressure. There was
brisk, and at times, violent fighting between the Germans and Allies
around Moreuil and Hangard. Attacks and counterattacks followed each
other in rapid succession, which resulted in the British gaining some
ground. If it was the purpose of the Germans to make a drive on
Amiens, this sector was of special importance, for it lay east of the
city between the Somme and the Avre. What encouraged the Allies' High
Command to believe that Amiens was the objective was the massing of
great numbers of German troops in this area and in the district around
Albert. In expectation of a heavy blow in these regions the Allies
brought into the battle front as rapidly as possible a great number of
guns. The Germans too were making artillery preparations, but their
guns were arriving slowly and not in considerable numbers. All day
long on April 1, 1918, they launched local attacks near Albert, but
were unable to make any impression on the iron wall of British
resistance.</p>

<p>On the same day the First German Guard Division, which had been
severely punished by the French at Grivesnes, returned to the assault,
but received such a warm reception that they were forced to seek
shelter in their positions, leaving the French masters of the
situation.</p>

<p>The British were active on the first of the month, carrying out some
successful actions. German positions in a wood along the Luce River
were stormed and after sharp fighting the enemy was forced to
withdraw, leaving the field strewn with dead. The Germans shelled the
wood after it was occupied by the British, and then organized two
counterattacks with the purpose of retaking it. Both attacks were
caught in the British artillery barrage and shattered. South of
Hangard the British improved their position and smashed two German
counterattacks which essayed to restore the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289"></a>(p. 289)</span> Early in the morning of April 4, 1918, the Germans launched a
new offensive. Amiens was evidently the objective toward which their
forces moved from three directions. One attack was made from the
northeast from the general direction of Albert, a second from the east
along the line of the Amiens-Resières railroad, and the third along
the Avre River where the French held the line. The Germans employed
fifteen divisions against the French and fourteen divisions against
the British, or nearly 350,000 men, attacking the Allies on a
sixteen-mile front. All day long and through the night the French were
assaulted with extreme violence. The Germans seemed determined to
break through at whatever cost, their immediate aim being the
Amiens-Paris railway. Despite their efforts, ten times repeated, the
Germans, at the cost of heavy sacrifices, only succeeded in gaining a
few hundred yards of territory, and occupied the villages of
Mailly-Raineval and Morisel, while the French still controlled the
heights in the neighborhood. Grivesnes was subjected to the fiercest
attacks, but the French troops held it securely, and broke down every
assault that was made by the enemy. The Germans were so badly battered
in the fighting that raged all day and night in this region that they
did not resume the offensive on the following day, and General Pétain
took advantage of the lull to launch successful counterattacks,
gaining ground notably in the region of Mailly-Raineval (south of
Moreuil) and Cantigny.</p>

<p>The northern and western outskirts of Cantigny, which was captured by
the Germans a few days before, were now in French hands.</p>

<p>While the French were stubbornly holding their own against superior
numbers, the British front south of the Somme was the scene of heavy
fighting. The battle raged all day and far into the night and the
British were forced back to new positions east of Villers-Bretonneux,
nine miles east of Amiens. North and south of Albert their lines were
heavily attacked along a front of about 9,000 yards between Aveluy and
Dernancourt. All that the Germans gained in the fighting in this
region was a foothold on a small triangular bit of territory just
southwest of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>(p. 290)</span> Albert, which brought the attacking troops close
to the Albert-Amiens railway.</p>

<p>The net results of the Germans during the two days' fighting were a
decided check and a very costly one.</p>

<p>On April 5, 1918, German forces engaged in massed attacks against the
British lines just east of Corbie on the Somme. South of Hangard Wood
the British were pushed back a short distance, but elsewhere the
Germans achieved only costly failures.</p>

<p>Despite trifling gains here and there by the enemy, the Allies had
every reason for feeling confident that the offensive would fail. In
the vital sector between Montdidier and the Luce River, where the
Germans were nearest to Amiens, their position was far from
satisfactory, and in the north, where they must advance their lines if
they wished to escape extreme danger, the situation was very bad
indeed. The British were holding fast to their positions above Albert
with indomitable courage, while the Germans were making a slow advance
here and there at the cost of heavy sacrifice.</p>

<p>In the course of the fighting during April 7-8, 1918, the Germans
made gains south of the Oise. Advancing toward the Ailette River they
captured Pierremande and Folembray, driving the French to the western
bank of the stream. The heights to the east of Coucy-le-Château were
captured, and another force advancing from Verneuil-Barisis occupied
the town of Verneuil.</p>

<p>Attacks and counterattacks continued along the British battle front.
The little village of Cucquoy, near Serre, continued to be the center
of the most determined German assaults. The place itself was nothing,
a mere mass of ruins torn by artillery fire, but the hills around were
occupied by the British, and the German advance was held up until
these positions could be captured or disposed of.</p>

<p>On April 9, 1918, after a heavy bombardment in which over 60,000 gas
shells were used, the Germans attacked British and Portuguese lines
from La Bassée Canal to the neighborhood of Armentières (a distance of
eleven miles).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>(p. 291)</span> The Portuguese in the center and the British on the flanks of
the river Lys between Estaires and Bac St. Maur were forced to retire
under the German pressure. Heavy fighting continued throughout the day
in this sector. In the vicinity of Givenchy and Fleurbaix the British
maintained their position and repulsed strong assaults. Richebourg St.
Vaast and Laventie were occupied by the enemy.</p>

<p>In the morning of April 10, 1918, the Germans launched a new attack,
with strong forces, against the British positions between the Lys
River and Armentières and the Ypres-Commines Canal. The British were
driven back to the line running through Wytschaete along the Messines
Ridge to Ploegsteert.</p>

<p>South of Armentières, after a prolonged struggle, the Germans crossed
the river Lys and established themselves on the left bank at a number
of points east of Estaires and near Bac St. Maur. Southward from
Estaires&mdash;the southern limit of the German offensive&mdash;the British
continued to hold their lines. Givenchy was recaptured from the
Germans, and 750 prisoners. The possession of this place was important
to the Allies, as it stands on high ground, and is a gateway on the
road to Béthune.</p>

<p>In the course of the two days' fighting in this region the Germans
advanced in the center to a depth of about 5,500 yards, the British
and Portuguese losing a considerable number of prisoners and guns.</p>

<p>In the retirement of the French forces to the line of the Ailette
River two French battalions were cut off and the Germans took 2,000
prisoners. The retirement of the French was made on account of an
awkward corner in the line.</p>

<p>The fighting during these days showed that it was the Germans' purpose
to exhaust the British army. Their first plan had been to cut off the
British from the French, but that failed. Now they attacked the
British wherever they saw a favorable chance, hoping to destroy such
large numbers that they would be unable to take the offensive.</p>

<p class="smcap">The German advance between Ypres and Arras, March-June,
1918.</p>
</div>

<p>During the night of April 9, 1918, the Germans made a strong assault
on the French lines near Hangard-en-Santerre. The French retaliated
with a counterblow that drove the enemy back <span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name="page293"></a>(p. 293)</span> in disorder. The
village changed hands repeatedly, but early in the morning of April
10, 1918, the French gained possession of the place and of a cemetery
near by, and established themselves strongly in the new positions.</p>

<p>All day long on April 11, 1918, the Germans were hurling great masses
of troops against the British lines on the northern front, from La
Bassée to the Ypres-Commines Canal southeast of Ypres. As the result
of these heavy assaults Haig's troops were forced back north of
Estaires and Steenwerck. The evacuation of Armentières followed. The
German advance on the previous day between Warneton and the Lys on the
north and their drive to the south of Armentières had subjected the
place to attack from three sides. For the British to attempt holding
the town under these conditions would have caused a useless sacrifice
of troops. Armentières had no military importance, but the
Messines-Wytschaete Ridge and the Passchendaele Ridge to the north of
it were of great value. As long as these positions held out the
British lines were safe. The Germans were confronted with the same
situation that prevailed on the Somme front. The German push toward
Amiens had been held up by the British possession of the Heights of
Vimy and of the Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. These formed the hinge on which
the whole British line swung as it moved westward. The same thing was
happening in the north. The British center had given way under the
fury of the German attacks, but the flanks held fast. On the north the
Messines Ridge blocked the way of the German advance. For in case of a
westward push both German flanks would be in great danger from this
bastion which commanded the entire field of maneuver. Their front and
rear as well as flanks would be subjected to destructive artillery
fire from this ridge which therefore became the center of the fighting
in the north.</p>

<p>The Germans recognizing the supreme importance of the ridge made
determined and valiant efforts to capture the position. They launched
one attack after another that were costly and brought no results. They
entered the British lines in the village of Messines, but were
promptly driven out in a brilliant <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>(p. 294)</span> counterattack and the
important positions remained in British hands.</p>

<p>In the area west and northwest of Armentières the British troops were
forced back in the fighting that continued throughout the day on April
12, 1918. The British retired to the neighborhood of the railway south
of Bailleul, where the heaviest fighting continued without respite.
The Germans captured Merville and drove the British forces operating
near Ploegsteert to retire to new positions in the neighborhood of
Neuve Église.</p>

<p>In the Hangard-en-Santerre sector of the French front to the southeast
of Amiens the struggle was prolonged throughout the day. The Germans
attacked with large forces, but the French held their own until late
in the day, when the enemy, reenforced by fresh troops in considerable
numbers, gained a portion of Hangard, while the French still held on
to the western part of the town. In the Noyon sector the Germans were
active with their artillery, but attempted no infantry attacks.
Rheims, the martyred city, was again bombarded, with the result that
a number of buildings were fired, especially in the vicinity of the
cathedral.</p>

<p>During the night of April 12-13, 1918, the Germans made a determined
drive for Neuve Église, three miles southwest of Messines, and after a
prolonged struggle occupied the village. The British vigorously
counterattacked in the morning and drove the enemy out, capturing a
battalion commander and a number of prisoners. There was hard fighting
at other points on the British front, the Germans losing ground at
Festubert. On the French front all enemy attacks broke down. Northwest
of Orvilles-Sorel French forces broke into the German line on a front
of three quarters of a mile and won a strip of territory.</p>

<p>The Germans continued to bring up fresh divisions into the Messines
sector, until twenty-three divisions were engaged. Neuve Église was
wrested from the British during the night of April 14, 1918. Seven
attacks were made on the British lines near Merville, only one of
which pushed back the British line and was successful in gaining
ground. The British in a dashing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>(p. 295)</span> counterattack drove out the
Germans and reoccupied the line. Bailleul and the neighborhood were
the scene of violent fighting. The Germans seemed determined to carry
the place at any cost. The town, which contained many handsome
buildings, was reduced to a mass of ruins. The German pressure forced
the British to evacuate the town in the night of April 15, 1918, after
they had been driven from the heights to the south and southeast. The
British troops fell back on the east and west line north of Wulverghem
and Bailleul.</p>

<p>On this date (April 15, 1918) the Germans made other notable gains.
Attacking the British on a nine-mile front, Haig's men were driven
from Wytschaete and most of the Messines Ridge positions were taken.
It will be recalled that this famous ridge was captured by the British
from the Germans on June 7, 1917, after elaborate mining preparations
had been made and 1,000,000 pounds of high explosives were used in
blowing up the heights.</p>

<p>Intense fighting continued all day long on April 16-17, 1918, about
the Messines Ridge and the Passchendaele Ridge to the north, forcing
the British to retire to their lines east of Ypres.</p>

<p>In the Hangard sector on the French front, where since the beginning
of the offensive the Germans had been hammering away in an effort to
get astride the railway connecting Amiens with Clairmont, the British
carried out a highly successful operation. At daybreak on April 17-18,
1918, along a front of about five miles between Thennes and
Mailly-Renneval, the French launched a dashing assault that resulted
in the capture of over 600 prisoners and the seizure of some important
points which the enemy occupied. The ground over which the French had
to charge had been transformed by recent rains into heavy mud into
which the attackers sank at times up to their knees, but they pushed
on undismayed. The commanding heights on the northern flank were
carried amid victorious cheers. In the center bodies of infantry
penetrated Senecat Wood and cleared up the gun emplacements which
defended the approaches to Castel. Pressing forward, the French
infantry established themselves on the outskirts of the town and
prepared for an assault on the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>(p. 296)</span> Toward the south other French units captured dominating
heights and advanced toward Anchin Farm on the road between
Ailly-sur-Noye and Moreuil. The French advance met with the strongest
opposition from the Germans, but their efforts were ineffective and
their casualties heavy.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the Germans in their continued pounding of the
French around Hangard was to prevent reenforcements being sent north.
This they failed to accomplish. The French not only fought them off
and gained ground, but were able to send a considerable force to the
northern front.</p>

<p>The fighting around Hangard, which was prolonged for days, was of the
most sanguinary description. Desperate hand-to-hand fighting took
place in the streets of the town and inside the houses. Hangard
changed hands again and again, but was finally occupied and strongly
held by the French.</p>

<p>The fighting continued with undiminished fury on the northern front,
but the Germans made no important gains. Attacks in the Mont Kemmel
region were beaten off. At Givenchy, and at other points of the
front, the Germans failed to gain ground, while great numbers were
slaughtered by the British machine-gun and rifle fire. It was
estimated that the Germans employed 137,000 men in their furious
assaults on the Allied front extending from Givenchy, eleven miles
northwest to the neighborhood of St. Venant. Important reenforcements
of French troops strengthened the British resistance in the north, and
German masses attempting to break through lost heavily.</p>

<p>During the week the Germans, employing picked troops, made violent
attacks on the Belgian front between Kippe and Langemarck, but were
unable to gain a foot of ground. The Belgians captured 714 prisoners,
a 77-millimeter gun, and 42 machine guns. Documents found on captured
German officers revealed the importance attached by the Germans to the
operation. They had planned to capture Merckem, Luyghem, Aschoop, and
neighboring towns, and after reaching the Ypres Canal purposed to push
on in the direction of Poperinghe and envelop the left of the Allies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>(p. 297)</span> At the close of the week (April 20, 1918) it was evident that
the German offensive had broken down, and that no more important
movement would be attempted for some time. In the Givenchy-Festubert
region (west of La Bassée) the British forces expelled the Germans
from some advanced points which they had occupied two days before.</p>

<p>A determined attack made by the Germans against the French lines north
of Seicheprey, in which the American troops fought with valor and
distinction, is described in another part of this work.</p>

<p>In summing up the operations of the week, it will be noted that the
fighting in the Lys region absorbed most of the German energy, and
that the British defense was strained at times nearly to the breaking
point. The German advance from the south was diverted by indomitable
British resistance encountered at Givenchy. Armentières was evacuated
to avoid an encircling movement, after which the German armies on the
north and south of the place joined hands. British divisions on the
north and south flanks remained firm, but the attack in the center was
pushed, and after the river Lawe was crossed Merville, Merris, and
Neuve Église were captured, when the advance was checked. The struggle
then narrowed down to Bailleul, Nieppe Forest, and Mont Kemmel, the
main objective being the capture of Hazebrouck. In the course of the
week's fighting these villages changed hands a number of times, but in
the end Bailleul fell and the Germans occupied Meterne, Wulverghem,
and Wytschaete, and an important section of Messines Ridge. This
rendered the forward line eastward of Ypres untenable, and the British
retired to new positions. The fighting at every point during the week
was of the most desperate character. The Germans found it difficult to
exploit their first successes in any direction but the most northern
and northwestern sectors, where they discovered a weak point and
concentrated a powerful attack. The Allied High Command had no reason
to feel discouraged, for the situation, though serious, gave ground
for confidence. The net result to the Germans was a small gain in
territory, but their losses in men had been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>(p. 298)</span> appalling. It was
no longer a question of overrunning territory in France, but the
destruction of man power that would count in the end.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

<p class="title">THE GERMAN OFFENSIVE RENEWED&mdash;YPRES THREATENED&mdash;THE ALLIES' HEAVY
LOSSES</p>


<p>The comparative quiet which had reigned for some days in the battle
area was broken on April 23, 1918, when the Germans, using two
divisions, attacked the whole British front south of the Somme, as
well as the French forces on the British right. Villers-Bretonneux,
the Germans' objective, stands on a ridge southeast of Amiens, an
important position in reference to that place. A preliminary
bombardment started at 3 o'clock in the morning and continued for
nearly four hours, when their infantry advanced upon
Villers-Bretonneux and the village of Cahy, from Hangard Wood,
Marcelcave, and from below Warfusee. Among the German troops engaged
were the Fortieth Guards Division, which had been fighting recently on
this front, and the Seventy-seventh Division, fresh from Russia and in
action here for the first time. At the hour the attack was launched a
third German division, the Thirteenth, of Westphalian troops, fell
upon the French near Castel to the south of the British forces. The
Germans, after a fierce struggle, succeeded in gaining a little
ground, when the French troops pivoted from the right and threw them
back.</p>

<p>On the British front the Germans used tanks for the first time in an
offensive, three of them advancing with the German infantry down the
road to Cahy and Domart.</p>

<p>German attacks on the northern and southern sectors of this front were
repulsed by the Allied troops, but the enemy made progress at
Villers-Bretonneux. The fighting here continued throughout the day
with unabated intensity and did not cease when the Germans captured
the village in the early evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>(p. 299)</span> Their attacks broke down on the northern bank of the Somme
and north of Albert. The British carried out a successful local
operation northwest of Festubert, where they recaptured a post which
the Germans had won on April 22.</p>

<p>British positions east of Robecq now came under strong enemy fire and
were subjected to several strong attacks. The British line remained
unbroken after every assault and the Germans were forced back, losing
eighty-four men as prisoners and a number of machine guns.</p>

<p>In the night British and Australian troops launched several
counterattacks against the positions the Germans had newly won in and
around Villers-Bretonneux.</p>

<p>The Germans had been long enough in possession of the town and the
neighborhood to set up strong defenses, and countless machine guns had
been placed wherever they could do the most harm. When the British
were driven out of the village after a hard fight it was late in the
day and the Germans evidently thought that they would not attempt a
counterattack until the following morning. But the British did not
purpose to give the enemy any time to bring up fresh troops, and
prepared for a night attack. They recognized the importance of
Villers-Bretonneux, as it gave the enemy full observation of the
British positions on both sides of the Somme Valley beyond Amiens.</p>

<p>The job of recapturing the village was given to the Australians who
had made a brilliant record in carrying out night attacks and rarely
failed of success. About midnight they set out, unpreceded by any
artillery preparation, feeling their way along in the dark and relying
solely on the weapons they carried with them.</p>

<p>The Australians broke into the village before the enemy woke up, and
supported by several British battalions spent the night in clearing
the Germans out of the place. The Germans were not disposed to
surrender such an important observation point and put up a stiff
fight, and the struggle raged for hours in the streets. Finally the
British and Australians gained the upper hand and the village proper
was freed of the enemy, who fell <span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>(p. 300)</span> back on positions in the
neighborhood. Fighting in the outskirts of the village continued in
the morning. There was no gunfire even then, for the British, Germans,
and Australians were so closely engaged in the struggle and so mixed
up that the gunners on both sides were afraid of killing their own
men.</p>

<p>On the western side of the village German machine gunners, cut off
from their lines by the sudden counterattack, were stoutly defending
themselves here and there among the remains of ruined buildings and
dealt the British some shrewd blows before they could be driven out,
or made prisoner. The British had escaped without severe casualties,
while the German toll of dead was costly, especially in officers. In
this operation the British captured between 700 and 800 prisoners.</p>

<p>In the Lys salient the Germans, employing large forces and aiming at
Mont Kemmel, launched a succession of violent attacks from Wytschaete
to Bailleul. The Allies made a brave resistance, but were compelled to
fall back on prepared positions toward the Locre River.</p>

<p>Mont Kemmel is a hill of great tactical importance. It is almost
covered with woods and stands out somewhat in front of the range of
heights extending westward to the Mont des Cats, and to some extent
dominating its western neighbors.</p>

<p>In the course of the fighting in this region (April 25-26, 1918) nine
German divisions (about 120,000 men) were engaged, and the Allies,
borne down by overwhelming numbers, were forced to give up the village
of Kemmel, the near-by summit of Kemmel, and the village of Dranoutre
to the south.</p>

<p>In the Somme-Avre battle area the French had been pitilessly hammered
by overpowering numbers of German troops. The fighting in and around
Hangard Wood was especially intense.</p>

<p>On April 25, 1918, the French repulsed seven assaults made on their
lines north of the wood and in Hangard, which changed hands several
times during the day. South of the Luce River the Germans were driven
out of important positions which the French occupied and held firmly
against repeated attempts made by the enemy to drive them out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>(p. 301)</span> The Germans had by this time advanced to within three miles
of Ypres, which was now threatened. The struggle for Voormezeele, the
point at which the Germans had pushed closest to Ypres from the south,
was prolonged and intense. They made a costly and futile effort to
capture the wood southwest of the town on the 26th. The attack was
desperately pushed, but met with disaster. Not only were their losses
heavy in dead, but several hundred prisoners were taken by the Allied
troops. Meanwhile the French were successful on their front from La
Clytte to Locre (two miles west of Kemmel). Strong bodies of German
troops under General von Arnim after four violent assaults captured
Locre, but the French organized a strong counterattack and regained
the village. They also won Hospice and Locrehof Farm, both strong
points lying southeast of the place.</p>

<p>Ypres now came under heavy fire of the German guns; high explosives
and gas shells rained down upon the ruins of the city for the first
time in some months. Fields and villages around hitherto untouched by
fire were showered with shells. The purpose was to catch the traffic
on the roads and destroy soldiers' camps, but the only result was a
few women and children killed.</p>

<p>Throughout the night of April 28, 1918, German batteries were active
from the Belgian front down through Flanders to the districts about
Béthune. About 6 o'clock in the morning, on the 29th, an attack was
made according to the plan of General von Arnim after gaining Kemmel
Hill; this was the capture of the chain of hills running westward
below Ypres to Poperinghe, among them such familiar landmarks as Mont
Rouge and Mont Noir. These hills, held at the time by the French, were
of great tactical importance, forming the central keep, as it were, in
the Allies' defense lines south of Ypres.</p>

<p>It was the purpose of the Germans, in case their frontal attacks
against the French failed, to break the British lines on the French
left between Locre and Voormezeele and on the French right near Merris
and Meteren, but all their efforts failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>(p. 302)</span> On April 28, 1918, British flyers discovered the Germans
massing troops on the road between Zillebeke and Ypres. A dense fog
prevailed at the time, and a surprise attack was evidently planned.
This never developed, for the assembly was promptly shelled by the
British gunners and dispersed. After a tremendous bombardment that
shook the whole countryside the German troops again assembled in the
misty dawn and were again dispersed by British guns. The fighting in
this area was almost continuous throughout the following day.</p>

<p>Around the Scherpenberg and Mont Rouge the Germans fiercely assailed
the French lines and succeeding in making a wedge for a time, captured
the crossroads, but were counterattacked by General Pétain's men, who
drove them out of most of the ground they had gained there.</p>

<p>A tremendous barrage was flung down by the German gunners from Ypres
to Bailleul, and somewhat later they began the battle by launching an
attack between Zillebeke Lake and Meteren. South of Ypres they crossed
the Yser Canal near Voormezeele with the purpose of striking the
British, while they tried to push past Locre against the French
holding the three hills. As a result of the day's fighting the
British lines remained intact, while General von Arnim's hosts were
shattered and decimated. On the French front the Germans won a little
ground, but it was unimportant in relation to the situation.</p>

<p>On April 29, 1918, French troops carried out a brilliant counterattack
in the night, recovering ground on the slope of the Scherpenberg and
advanced their line 1,500 yards astride the Dranoutre road. They alone
drove the Germans out of positions around Locre and entered into full
possession of the village itself.</p>

<p>The Germans still occupied Mont Kemmel, but their hold on the height
was of little value, as the Allied artillery kept the summit smothered
with shell fire, making it impossible for the enemy to maintain any
considerable body of troops there.</p>

<p>The French and British were elated over the outcome, for the greatest
effort made by the Germans in the Flanders offensive had failed. In
addition to a large number of divisions in position <span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>(p. 303)</span> at the
beginning of the battle the Germans had employed about thirty fresh
battalions of reserves. Von Armin's great thrust had been carefully
planned and his troops fought with reckless bravery if not with
distinction. The French and British had defeated him with relatively
smaller forces and had shown that their men were more than equal to
the best German soldiers. Owing to the close fighting and frequent
hand-to-hand encounters, the Franco-British capture of prisoners (over
5,000) was less than might have been expected in a struggle of such
magnitude.</p>

<p>While the Germans up to the first of May had failed to make any
farther advance on the scale of the first days of the big offensive,
they were still a menace to be reckoned with. It was estimated that
they had already thrown 2,000,000 men into the line, but many fresh
divisions were available for further efforts. They had enough men in
their depots in the interior to fill all their gaps for some time; but
reconstituted divisions, as is well known, never equal in fighting
quality the original formation, as a large number of slightly wounded
men after recuperation is included.</p>

<p>As the Germans did not publish their losses, no correct estimate could
be formed. Conservative opinion placed the number as over 350,000 men.
The Germans had 186 divisions on the western front when the offensive
began, and reenforcements brought from Russia and other fronts raised
the number to 210 divisions; a German division consisting of about
12,000 men.</p>

<p>For some time it was a mystery to the Allies as to how the Germans
succeeded in bringing forward new divisions into the battle area and
so often escaping the notice of the vigilant French and British
observers. This the Germans accomplished by exercising the greatest
precaution and cunning.</p>

<p>In the first place the territory occupied by each German army corps
was divided into two zones, the first of which might be under
observation of the Allies' lookouts, and the other only from captive
balloons which had a wide radius of view. According to German army
orders, infantry occupying the first zone were forbidden on clear days
to move in any greater number <span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304"></a>(p. 304)</span> than four men together, mounted
men not more than two together, and vehicles not more than two at a
time, with a minimum of 300 yards between groups. In heavy, misty
weather, these restrictions were relaxed and the movement of groups of
forty foot soldiers, twenty cavalrymen, and ten vehicles was
permitted.</p>

<p>In the second zone it was permissible to form groups of the size
allowed in the first zone, on days of poor visibility, but there must
be intervals of 500 yards. It was in this manner that the Germans'
military movements were often hidden from the Allies' observers.
German divisions making forced marches in the night slept in the
villages during the day, and were heavily punished if they showed
themselves in the streets.</p>

<p>No infantry operations were attempted by the Germans on May 1-2, 1918,
but German gunners continued at regular intervals to bombard the
Franco-British lines. General Pétain took advantage of the lull in the
fighting to advance his lines between Hailles and Castel (south of the
Avre), meeting with little opposition, capturing Hill 82 and the wood
near by bordering on the river.</p>

<p>The Germans became active again on May 3, 1918, when, after a heavy
artillery barrage, they attacked British positions south of Locon (on
the southern flank of the Lys salient). They were easily repulsed and
made no further attempt that day to renew the attack. On May 4th,
1918, British and French troops carried out a successful operation
between Locre and Dranoutre, gaining ground on a half-mile front to an
average depth of 500 yards and capturing a number of prisoners. The
Germans were driven from three ruined farms that were perfect
strongholds, and high ground was won by the Allies near Koutkot (west
of Dranoutre). All these local successes were of real value, for they
strengthened the Allied defenses of the approach to Scherpenberg and
Mont Rouge.</p>

<p>May 5, 1918, was a great day for those irrepressible fighters, the
Australians, who gave the Germans a bad thrashing west and southwest
of Morlancourt between the Ancre and the Somme Rivers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305"></a>(p. 305)</span> The Australians' attack was made on a front of 2,500 yards
unheralded by any preliminary bombardment, but the British guns became
active after they were on their way, keeping roads and tracks under
fire to prevent the enemy from bringing up supports.</p>

<p>The German garrison on this front did not occupy any definite trench
system, but occupied scattered rifle pits and rifle trenches just
large enough to afford shelter for small groups and machine-gun crews.
These hornets' nests were dangerous things to tackle, but the
Australians had dealt with such conditions before and went about their
work in a cool and businesslike manner. With bombs and bayonets the
Germans were killed or driven out of their holes, and as they were all
picked men selected for their courage and long experience in warfare
they made a gallant resistance. The Australian generally fights better
when he has a desperate opponent, and the struggle became intense and
at close quarters. In the end the men from overseas crushed all
opposition, killing over 150 Germans and taking about 200 prisoners.
The success of this minor operation was of some importance, as it
enabled the Allies to advance their line 500 yards.</p>

<p>At this time, in the course of the offensive, the Germans introduced,
as a new form of "frightfulness," a sneezing powder, that was fired by
high explosive shells. The sneezing powder sifts down through the gas
masks and causes sneezing when the wearer is forced to take off his
mask and receives the full effect of the lethal gases which the
Germans had spread abroad.</p>

<p>Preparations were now under way for a new offensive. It was known to
the Allies that Ludendorff had already massed 70 divisions and that
reenforcements of men and guns were daily brought into the fighting
area. The Germans now sought for a basis for a new drive, feeling
their way by making thrusts here and there on the Allies' front. On
May 8, 1918, they made a drive at the British lines in the battle area
north of Kemmel in the Lys salient, penetrating trenches between La
Clytie and Voormezeele. About 25,000 German troops took part in this
attack. In the night General Haig's men came back in force and drove
them out, but the Germans contested the field again and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>(p. 306)</span> again
during the following day. They won a little ground here and there, but
were eventually thrown back and the British remained in sole
possession of the terrain.</p>

<p>North of Albert the Germans captured a small but important strip of
trenches on high ground. Their temporary success was dearly won, for
they suffered terrible slaughter from the rifle and machine-gun fire
which poured into their ranks as they advanced up the slopes. By a
brilliant counterassault the Germans were driven out of the position
won before they could organize the defenses. East of Bouzincourt,
where the British occupied positions on high ground, the enemy
followed much the same tactics, but they were unable to gain even
temporary foothold in the British defenses. The graycoats advanced,
shouting in English "retire," in the hopes of confusing the British.
The response of the defenders was such a fierce fire that the Germans
acted on their cry and fell back in disorganized masses, leaving hosts
of dead on the field.</p>

<p>Along the greater part of the front military operations were now
confined to small enterprises. The Allies assumed a waiting attitude
expecting that the enemy would show his hand. The Germans had brought
a large number of divisions into the line facing Amiens, indicating an
offensive in that direction. The attempts to "feel out" the Allies'
strength had received so many setbacks that they hesitated to begin
any new operation on a large scale.</p>

<p>Days passed and still the Germans failed to start a great offensive.
It was a period officially called "quiet," though on many parts of the
front the guns were active, and raids and minor operations were
carried out every day and night. There was continued fighting between
French and Germans for the possession of Mont Kemmel, which changed
hands again and again. Its value lay in the fact that the hill
dominates considerable territory, and for that reason was long a thorn
in the flesh of the ambitious Germans.</p>

<p>The anticipated German offensive so long delayed was begun on May 27,
1918. At 1 a. m. a terrific bombardment in which gas shells
predominated was opened along a forty-mile front <span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name="page307"></a>(p. 307)</span> between
Noyon and Rheims. The hurricane of fire continued undiminished for
three hours when the Germans launched an assault with about 325,000
men against the Franco-British lines.</p>

<p>The German objective was the famous plateau, the Chemin-des-Dames, a
long, bare ridge whose widest part is on the west and narrowest above
Craonne. It was against this narrowest point on the ridge that was
held by a British division that the main blow was aimed. The German
forces, which far exceeded in numbers the defenders of the ridge,
included some of the specially trained units that had fought in Von
Hutier's army in March, two divisions of the Prussian Guards, and
other crack formations. Having gained the ridge at a heavy cost, the
Germans pressed on westward. The Allies retreated toward the Aisne,
inflicting, as they fell back, heavy losses on the Germans, who drove
forward great masses of troops over their dead comrades' bodies. The
Germans pushed on over an eighteen-mile front in pursuit of the Allies
and crossed the river.</p>

<p>North of the Aisne the Germans carried by storm a number of towns and
drove a wedge southward from the Aisne to Fismes on the River Vesle,
which the Germans crossed at several points. In the sector northwest
of Rheims the British troops were forced back toward Berry-au-Bac and
across the Aisne-Marne Canal. As a result of the first day's fighting
the Germans advanced 10 miles and claimed the capture of 15,000
prisoners.</p>

<p>On the second day of the offensive the Germans continued their attacks
on the French troops on the right wing of the Aisne offensive, and
forced them to evacuate Soissons except for the western outskirts.
German forces of the center were now in possession of the territory
between the Aisne and Vesle Rivers, and a considerable area to the
south of the last-named stream, having extended their advance in this
region four miles.</p>

<p>The fighting continued unabated all day on May 30, 1918, in the
Aisne-Vesle area between Soissons and Rheims. The German flanks near
these two cities being firmly held by the French, the Germans were
throwing their entire strength southward evidently with the intention
of establishing themselves on the Marne. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308"></a>(p. 308)</span> This would enable
them to direct their main efforts westward, counting on the river to
protect their flank. On the whole southern front the fighting was of
the most violent character, and it was here that the Allies had to
give most ground. Fère-en-Tardenois, four or five miles south of the
farthest point of the German advance on the 29th, was occupied by the
Germans. They also captured Vezilly to the eastward. In the Rheims
sector the crown prince's forces occupied the northern parts of La
Neuvillette and Betheny, a mile nearer to Rheims on the northwest and
northeast.</p>

<p>The most serious blow to the Allies in the German advance was not the
loss of 35,000 men which the Germans claimed as prisoners, for that
was a comparatively small number in an offensive of such magnitude,
but the loss of artillery and stores which was enormous. The depth of
the German advance had carried their lines beyond the positions of
even the heaviest guns of the Allies. It is a slow process to move
great cannon, as tractors are required, and so in the swift onrush,
many were captured with ammunition dumps containing great stores of
shells.</p>

<p>On May 31, 1918, the Germans extended their effort on the right as
far as the Oise by heavy attacks in the region of the Ailette. The
French were driven back, fighting, on positions to the north of the
line of Blerancourt-Epagny. In the region of Soissons, and farther
south, the German assault was shattered by the brilliant fighting of
the French, who maintained their position on the western outskirts of
the town, and along the road to Château-Thierry. In the center the
Germans were advancing north of the Marne and gained positions south
of Fère-en-Tardenois. This forward movement of about eight miles,
which the Germans had carried out in the space of twenty-four hours
against strong opposition, was indeed a notable military achievement.
They also forced the withdrawal of French lines northwest of Soissons
toward Noyon, thus linking up the Aisne operations with those on the
Picardy front.</p>

<p class="smcap">The German drive toward Paris which began May 27, 1918.
The map shows their farthest advance.</p>
</div>

<p>In this advance the Germans had the advantage of superior numbers and
moreover the French troops were tired out, having fought almost
continuously day and night for nearly a week. As <span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>(p. 310)</span> an added
advantage the Germans were well equipped with light and heavy machine
guns, which were kept going all the time.</p>

<p>Eastward, in the neighborhood of Rheims, where the French and British
were fighting together, the Germans were unable to make any progress
of importance. South of Soissons they attempted to renew their
advance. In this thrust they employed a number of tanks, but met with
strong resistance from the French and were driven back without gaining
a foot of ground.</p>

<p>The Germans claimed to have captured, in the course of the offensive,
45,000 prisoners, 400 guns, and several thousand machine guns.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>

<p class="title">DAYS FOR THE ALLIES&mdash;THE GERMAN OFFENSIVE DECLINES&mdash;FRENCH GAIN IN THE
RHEIMS REGION&mdash;BRITISH VICTORY AT HAMEL</p>


<p>The situation that confronted the Allies had become serious. It was
impossible to question the importance of the German advance. In the
center of their new line of attack they had won their strategic
objective, the Marne, there to establish a new front, and make
preparations for pressing the fight on a new north and south line
between Soissons and Château-Thierry.</p>

<p>If the Germans were successful, they would be able to advance westward
toward Paris and complete the new front by joining up with their
positions around Noyon at the head of the Oise Valley.</p>

<p>Continuing their successful advance to the Marne, they turned their
energies toward the west and made an advance of five miles along the
Ourcq River to the neighborhood of Neuilly and Cheny. In the region
between Hartennes and Soissons farther north the Germans were unable
to make any important gains, owing to the stubborn resistance of the
French forces, increased by fresh troops brought into the battle area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311"></a>(p. 311)</span> The Germans, though vastly superior in numbers over the
Allies, continued to swell their fighting force. The formidable nature
of their effort may be gauged from the identification of the
Franco-British officers of nearly fifty of their divisions, or about
675,000 men. They had also many other divisions in immediate support.
Opposing this mighty host the French and British had about a fifth of
this number engaged, and although the Germans succeeded in throwing
the Allies back, they had not been able to make a breach in their
lines.</p>

<p>The German drive in the main area of activity between Château-Thierry
and Soissons began to weaken during June 1-2, 1918, owing to the vigor
of the French counterattacks, which continued day and night.</p>

<p>North of the Aisne the crown prince's forces succeeded in capturing
Mont de Choissy (northwest of Soissons) after strong attacks, but only
held it a short time when they were driven out by French bayonets.</p>

<p>During the night of June 1, 1918, operating between Soissons and
Château-Thierry, the Germans with strong forces and operating in a
five-mile front, made a gain of three miles over the previous day's
advance, occupying the towns of Longpont, Corcy, Faverolles, and
Troesnes. Later all these places but Faverolles were won back by the
French.</p>

<p>On the Marne the situation remained unchanged. The Germans were in
possession of the eastern half of Château-Thierry while the French
occupied the western half of the town.</p>

<p>Northwest of this place, in the Neuilly St. Front region, the French
made some headway, driving the Germans back on Passy-en-Valois and
capturing an elevation known as Hill 163.</p>

<p>The German push had now slowed down. They continued local attacks that
failed in every instance. The French held firm north of the Aisne, the
most important sector of the battle front. The problem confronting the
Germans was to link up the front in Picardy with that along the Aisne,
which would extend their positions at Amiens, but this they had failed
to accomplish. South of the Forest of Villers-Cotterets they had made
repeated efforts to extend their positions along the Marne and throw
the French <span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>(p. 312)</span> back toward the Ourcq, but met only with defeat.
It was along this stretch of the line that the American troops, as
noted elsewhere, gave the French such valuable support.</p>

<p>In Flanders the situation of the German forces was much the same; they
were held in a wedge, the sides of which they could not break through,
one heel of the wedge being on high ground west of Kemmel and the
other on the ridge in the rear of Béthune.</p>

<p>In the Aisne fighting area Germans were also held in a wedge much
larger in extent, one heel of which was about Rheims, and the other
west of Soissons. From this position the Germans must sooner or later
endeavor to extricate themselves.</p>

<p>One of the most important factors in the battle, the mastery of the
air, had passed to the Allies. German troops attacking or on the march
were harried without respite by the Allies' pilots flying at tree-top
level. Day and night centers behind the German lines were bombed on a
scale hitherto undreamed of. In one day the French launched
sixty-three tons of bombs at important points on the German bases.</p>

<p>June 6, 1918, on the Picardy front, the Americans made an advance of
two and a half miles in the Château-Thierry sector. Details of the
fighting here will be found in another place. Between the Ourcq and
the Marne, French and American troops made an attack that resulted in
the gain of two-thirds of a mile in the neighborhood of
Veuilly-la-Peterie and the capture of nearly 300 prisoners.</p>

<p>The Franco-American forces continued to make gains with an advance in
the Chezy sector northwest of the line. The Germans, it appeared, were
in an exhausted condition and their resistance lacked spirit.</p>

<p>The Allies' reconquest of dominant points had greatly improved the
tactical situation. German efforts in the Marne Valley were fading out
now that they were confronted by the Allies' forces in numbers
proportionate to their own.</p>

<p>An important attack was launched by the Germans early in the morning
of June 9, 1918, on a front of more than twenty miles; between
Montdidier and Noyon. They gained ground in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313"></a>(p. 313)</span> center to a
depth of two and a half miles and to a less degree on the wings of the
attack. The southern limit of the German thrust was the villages of
Ressons-sur-Matz and Mareuil. The French kept them from crossing the
covering zone, and on the French right toward Noyon they were
similarly held.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of experienced military observers that the war had
witnessed no more severe fighting than in this sector, which resulted
indeed in a German advance, but at what a cost! When the German
infantry began coming over in dense masses they encountered a
withering fire of machine guns and artillery that mowed them down in
groups and cut great gaps in the moving wall. But as fast as the ranks
melted away fresh waves of men swept forward and filled the empty
spaces, and the massacre, for such it should be called, continued.
Only the iron discipline of German military rule could have forced
soldiers to face such tornadoes of fire.</p>

<p>It was evident that the prowess of the American soldier had
stimulated the German command to take the most desperate chances, in
the hope of forcing a decision before the Allies were further
reenforced by the troops of the great republic. There could be no
other explanation for the Germans' reckless waste of man power, the
frenzied attempts to crush a foe by sheer weight of numbers.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of June 11, 1918, the French evacuated the
Dreslincourt-Ribecourt angle, and fell back on the Matz. This region,
with its numerous valleys and wooded hills, offered facilities for the
tactics of "infiltration." Once it was turned by way of the Matz, the
defenders, with the Oise behind them, could not continue to hold firm
without risking great losses of men and material.</p>

<p>During the night of June 10, 1918, an enemy offensive, employing large
numbers of fresh troops, attacked the French forces farther west, and
flung them back along the Estrées Road as far as the Arende Valley.
The French, however, had brought up reserves and in a dashing
counterattack the enemy ranks were broken, an operation which brought
them back to their former positions south of Belloy and Marqueglise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314"></a>(p. 314)</span> By the prodigal waste of men (and it must be acknowledged
that there was method in some of the madness) the Germans had obtained
these results. By forcing their way down the Matz Valley at a
prodigious cost the German columns had reached forward from Rassons to
Marqueglise, Vandelicourt, and Elincourt, thus turning the wooded
plateau of Thiescourt to the southwest.</p>

<p>These operations left the French cornered on the narrow range of hills
before Ribecourt on the Oise, with another salient on the other side
of the river, consisting of the woods of Ourscamp and Carlepont, which
occupied low ground.</p>

<p>A strong effort was made on the German right to widen the front of the
offensive movement. They had advanced from Mortemer and Cuvilly beyond
Belloy and the hamlet of St. Maur. The columns of General von Hutier
were now within a few miles of Estrées St. Denis and Compiègne,
respectively, road and railway junctions of some importance.</p>

<p>During the night of June 10, 1918, Australian troops carried out a
highly successful movement which advanced the British lines on the
battle front north of the river Somme between Sailly-Laurette and
Morlancourt.</p>

<p>The Australians drove forward along the high ground which runs east
and west below Morlancourt. They attacked on a front of over a mile
and a half, advancing the line south of the village about half a mile
and capturing 233 prisoners, 21 machine guns and considerable war
material.</p>

<p>Southeast of Montdidier, on June 11, 1918, the Germans were about to
strike a hard blow with four divisions, when the French forestalled
them by a sudden attack. The battle continued throughout the night and
morning hours of the following day, the Allies advancing their line to
the east of Mery, a point of considerable importance, as it commands
the valley and surroundings. Toward the center the Germans struck a
succession of hard blows at the line, but it held fast, although some
enemy detachments succeeded in penetrating the Matz Valley through the
woods. The French fought yard by yard as the Germans tried by
overwhelming numbers to drive them back. The result of the fighting in
this region, which lasted for two days and a night, was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>(p. 315)</span> a
small gain of ground for the Germans, but this was won at such a heavy
price that the French considered they had won a victory.</p>

<p>Fighting continued on the Montdidier-Noyon battle ground on the
following day, the French pushing forward around Belloy and St. Maur
and gathering in prisoners, some cannon, and machine guns. In the
center Foch's troops were holding fast, but on the right the Germans,
after repeated efforts, gained a foothold on the southern bank of the
Matz River, and occupied the village of Melicocq and the heights near
by. East of the Oise along the line of Bailly, Tracy-le-Val and
Nampoel the French troops withdrew under the protection of covering
detachments without the enemy being aware of the movement. In the
region east of Veuilly, where the French were fighting at the left of
the United States marines and infantry, considerable ground was
gained. Montcourt was occupied, and the southern portion of Bussières.</p>

<p>On June 13, 1918, the Germans gathered strong forces, between 30,000
and 40,000 men, and attacked the line from Courcelles to Mery. As a
result, they were heavily punished and after eight hours of costly
efforts were forced back, their ranks shattered and in an exhausted
condition. The fifth day of the fighting marked a definite check of
enemy operations. The Allies were well content since the Germans had
paid such an enormous cost for the ground they had gained. The
five-days' battle west of the Oise had ended for the Germans in a
costly reverse after they had made an advance varying from two to six
miles.</p>

<p class="smcap">The German thrust south of Ypres and where it was
stopped.</p>
</div>

<p>This last offensive showed that the Germans had not been able to
maintain the driving power that characterized their first onrush. In
their drive on Amiens, which lasted for ten days, the Allies lost a
tract of territory forty miles deep, and their casualties were heavy.
The German attack in the north was of about the same duration, but
their gains were much less. After the conquest of the Chemin-des-Dames
the crown prince's forces had pushed on to the Marne, twenty-five
miles distant, but here they had been unable to carry out any
successful operations. In studying the situation the Germans' gain in
territory was not of first importance. They had failed to attain their
object, which was to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317"></a>(p. 317)</span> divide the French and British army and
then destroy one of them, and their attempt in a series of converging
operations to crush both Allies was also a failure.</p>

<p class="smcap">Where Foch definitely stopped the German offensive,
June 14, 1918.</p>
</div>

<p>The German offensive for the time being was now definitely checked,
and no important operations were undertaken. Trench raids and
bombardments were of daily and nightly occurrence, but along the
fighting front it was "a quiet period" in a military sense.</p>

<p>During the night of June 14-15, 1918, British and Scottish troops by a
swift stroke attacked German outpost lines on a front of about two
miles and won a long strip of ground, with 200 prisoners and about 25
machine guns. The scene of this interesting operation was before
Hinges, and the Allies had a special grudge against the Germans
occupying the posts in this neighborhood, for some of them belonged to
the Eighteenth German Division of infamous memory; the first German
division to enter Belgium at the beginning of the war, and active
participants in the reign of terror at Louvain and Termonde. This
division had been fighting ever since they were shooting civilians in
Belgium, and there were probably few left of Von Kluck's original
forces, for they had been marked out for special attention by the
British and French.</p>

<p>This neat operation carried out by the British in the Lys sector was
duplicated by the French on the following day when they attacked north
and northwest of Hautebraye, between the Oise and the Aisne, and
improved their positions there. The Germans counterattacked with fury,
but were thrown back on their own lines. The French took 375 prisoners
and 25 machine guns.</p>

<p>On June 18, 1918, the comparative quiet which had reigned for some
days on the French front was broken. At 9 o'clock in the evening the
First German Army under the command of General Fritz von Below made a
frontal attack upon the salient of which the devastated city of Rheims
formed the head. It was estimated that the Germans had 40,000 troops
engaged in the assault along the front extending from Vrigny Plateau
to Sillery.</p>

<p>The orders were to carry the city at all costs, a counterblow to
compensate the Germans for their failure to capture Compiègne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318"></a>(p. 318)</span> The counterbattery work of the French gunners dislocated all
their plans and their losses were enormous. At every point the Germans
were thrown back. So admirably was the French artillery served that
the Germans gained nothing even in the first onrush, though hundreds
of their cannon were busy and high explosives and gas shells were
showered on the French lines.</p>

<p>The front of the new German attack was the semicircle they had drawn
about Rheims in the recent offensive on the Aisne front. The Rheims
region comprised the left flank of the German attack. The French had
given ground on both sides of the city, but still held Rheims itself
and the protecting forts near by. As the Germans hemmed in the city on
three sides, it was only a question of time when they would attempt to
drive out the defenders. The attack we have described was on a front
from Viny, west of the city, to La Pompelle, and approximately
fourteen miles.</p>

<p>In the Seicheprey region, and northwest of Montdidier, in front of
Cantigny, and in the neighborhood of Belleau Wood, the American
troops, as noted elsewhere, were fighting with valor and distinction.</p>

<p>For some days following trench and air raids constituted the principal
activities on the French front. The Germans "lay low," but it was well
known that they were preparing for a new offensive, as they were
cunningly maneuvering into position their reserves for an attack.
There were no sure indications where the blow would fall.</p>

<p>The Allies meanwhile were busy "nibbling" at the enemy lines whenever
a chance offered, gaining ground and taking prisoners in minor
operations that amounted to little when judged separately, but were of
importance in the aggregate.</p>

<p>The Germans received a surprise and a shaking up, on June 28, 1918,
when some British battalions attacked them opposite the Forest of
Nieppe, to the west of Merville. The British advanced on a front of
about three miles. Opposing them were two divisions of Saxons and
Prussians, the 32d Saxon and the 44th German. They were making ready
for breakfast when the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name="page319"></a>(p. 319)</span> British bombardment opened upon them,
preceding the advance of British infantry.</p>

<p>The surprise of the Germans was complete, for the British were upon
them before they could do much. Some of the British troops found a
trench that had been dug between two organized shell holes, where they
captured forty of the enemy and a number of machine guns. These they
proceeded to turn on German positions ahead and in a short time it was
all over, the British winning their objective with only light
casualties. Everything had passed smoothly for the British; what their
soldiers called "a romp." And the results were worth while. They had
captured a strip of territory three miles wide and nearly a mile deep,
and taken over 350 prisoners and 22 machine guns.</p>

<p>At the same hour the British launched this attack the Australians
carried out a minor operation west of Merris which resulted in the
capture of German outposts and a considerable number of prisoners and
guns.</p>

<p>In the night of June 29, 1918, the French carried out a brilliant
coup south of the Forest of Villers-Cotterets. Driving forward along a
front of 1.8 miles, they advanced their line 800 yards, capturing a
height of considerable strategic importance between Molloy and
Passy-en-Valois. Nearly 1,200 Germans were taken and a number of
machine guns.</p>

<p>On the same night the British made a drive at the German lines north
of Albert, and forced them out of a strong position which they held on
the tip of a crest overlooking the valley of the Ancre. The British
assault was entirely successful. The important position was won and
all the highest ground in the vicinity.</p>

<p>That the American troops in France were becoming well seasoned
fighters was shown on July 1, 1918, when they captured the village of
Vaux, and the Bois de la Roche west of Château-Thierry. Details of
this interesting operation will be found in another place.</p>

<p>After a day of quiet on the rest of the front, French forces operating
in the neighborhood of Autrèches, northwest of Soissons, made a drive
at the German lines, and gained nearly half <span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320"></a>(p. 320)</span> a mile of
territory. A second attack delivered later in the same region between
Autrèches and Moulin-sous-Toutevent gave them more ground. In these
drives the French captured more than 1,000 prisoners.</p>

<p>The Australian troops, who had always shown a fondness for giving the
Germans surprise parties, carried out another on July 4, 1918, when
advancing on a four-mile front they gained territory a mile and a half
deep, including the village of Hamel and the trench system beyond it
south of the Somme. In this dashing advance over 1,500 Germans were
captured.</p>

<p>The Australians went over the top about 3 o'clock in the morning. The
British artillery in this region was very strong and quite smothered
the Germans' guns, which were late in getting under way.</p>

<p>The Germans had four divisions on this front holding the ground south
of Vaux-sur-Somme, garrisoning the village of Hamel and Vaire Wood and
the trench system on the other side of Hamel.</p>

<p>The advance of the Australians was facilitated by a squadron of tanks
which led the way. Heavy smoke screens hid the moving forts from the
German antitank guns. Behind these lumbering monsters came the
infantry in open lines, following closely the barrage as it moved
slowly forward ahead of them.</p>

<p>The first stages of the Australian advance were made through
semidarkness, but by the time they had reached the German lines light
from a pale sky was sifting through the fog and there was fair
visibility.</p>

<p>Three or four British tanks came to grief, but their casualties were
small, since by this time the Australians were masters of the
situation as the Germans were tumbling out of their trenches and
dugouts and surrendering in batches.</p>

<p>Over the battle field the British aviators were flying back and forth,
dipping down now and again to drop bombs on the German positions. The
village of Hamel next received their attention and though mostly in
ruins, the flyers, using their bombs freely, started many fires in the
place, and the German garrison must have had an uncomfortable time of
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page321" name="page321"></a>(p. 321)</span> After the British guns had further crushed resistance, Hamel
was rushed by the Australians and taken with the loss of only a few
men. In Vaire and Hamel Woods, where many German machine guns were
stationed and which were strongly held by considerable forces, the
Australians made record time in "mopping them up." In less than two
hours after they went over the top they had completed the job,
eliminating a salient in the British line and gaining much valuable
territory.</p>

<p>The German guns in this region did not get really into action until
the fight was over, when they began to shell the new Allied positions.
In the evening they launched three counterattacks on the wings and
center of the Australian lines, but were not pressed with spirit and
failed.</p>

<p>In honor of American Independence Day the little French villages close
to the firing line displayed the tricolor and American flags. Some of
the latter were of home manufacture and lacking in essential details,
but they symbolized the friendly feeling of the French toward the
great republic.</p>

<p>In proportion as the Germans ceased to press the offensive the French
increased their raids on the German lines, capturing positions and
points of observation which, apart from their present importance, were
valuable assets for the future.</p>

<p>The German command claimed to have taken 15,000 prisoners when the
offensive of June 9, 1918, was arrested. Since that date the French
and their American comrades had captured about 10,000 Germans in raids
and minor operations and had regained quite as much territory as the
hordes of General von Hutier had overrun. In the week closing July 6,
1918, the French alone had taken over 4,000 prisoners. All the
irregularities in the French line across the Oise to the Marne at
Château-Thierry had moreover been straightened out and the defenses
strengthened and powerfully organized against future attacks.</p>

<p>On July 6, 1918, the Australians who had carried out such a brilliant
attack on the German lines south of the Somme on the Fourth of July
began another push in the same sector.</p>

<p>The Germans had been so badly battered in the previous encounter that
they had not attempted to retaliate, but had established <span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322"></a>(p. 322)</span> some
advanced posts in no-man's-land which the Australians thought it wise
to wipe out. It was known that an epidemic of Spanish influenza was
raging among the German troops in this sector, which accounted in a
measure for the very poor showing they made. That their morale was
shaken may be illustrated by the following incident: After one of the
German outposts was under rifle and grenade fire for some time a
British soldier went out to see the effect of the damage done. Almost
immediately a German officer and twelve men came tumbling out of a
dugout and surrendered to him, and the proud Tommy led back his
baker's dozen of captives to the British lines.</p>

<p>The Australians in this push on the 6th advanced their line by about
400 yards over a front of about a mile beyond Hamel, which rounded out
the gains made in this sector on July 4, 1918.</p>

<p>The Germans continued inactive as far as military operations were
concerned, but back of their lines vast preparations were under way,
as noted by the Allies' observers, and it was evident that a new
offensive would not long be delayed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the French continued to make gains daily. On July 8, 1918,
southwest of Soissons, General Pétain's men broke the German line on a
two-mile front in the outskirts of Retz Forest, in the region of
Longpont. In this push the French gained three-fourths of a mile,
occupying Chavigny Farm and the ridges and heights to the north and
south of the farm. In this operation the French captured nearly 400
Germans, of whom four were officers.</p>

<p>A new stroke against the enemy was delivered by the French on the
following day when they attacked west of Antheuil between Montdidier
and the River Oise on a front of two and a half miles, piercing it to
a depth of more than a mile at some points, and making prisoners of
450 men, including fourteen officers. Later the Germans attempted to
counterattack in this sector, but it was pressed with vigor and they
were thrown back on their own lines.</p>

<p class="smcap">The line-up at the great German offensive, March-June,
1918.</p>
</div>

<p>Up in Flanders there was violent shelling of the British roads around
the Scherpenberg, which was the outer bastion of the Allies' defense.
Farther to the south the Australians had advanced <span class="pagenum"><a id="page324" name="page324"></a>(p. 324)</span> their line
beyond the German outpost positions near Morris on a 1,200-yard front.</p>

<p>Near the Aisne the French infantry broke the Germans' defenses at
several points north of Chavigny Farm. They took possession of the
quarries on the east, pushed forward to the outskirts of Longpont, and
penetrated the northern section of Corcy. This town was captured on
the following day (July 11, 1918), together with the railway station
and the château to the south of the place, an important observation
point.</p>

<p>The Germans were evidently too much occupied with preparations for a
new offensive to trouble themselves with minor operations, as for
several days they had only attempted a few feeble attacks that failed
in every instance.</p>

<p>In the course of July 12, 1918, the French delivered two hard blows
against the German lines that are deserving of record. The most
important was struck in Picardy when General Pétain's troops,
advancing on a three-mile front north of Mailly-Raineval, broke into
the German front to the depth of a mile and a quarter. The village of
Castel on the Avre River and important positions south of the village
were occupied by the victors, who captured over 500 prisoners of all
ranks.</p>

<p>The second blow was delivered in the area southwest of Soissons, where
the French had been "nibbling away" for some days with satisfactory
results. Here they captured the village of Longpont, a continuation of
their advance north of Chavigny Farm and east of Faverolles.</p>

<p>On July 14, 1918, the national fête day of the French Republic, the
British and American troops joined heartily in the celebration, and
little flags of the Allies fluttered among the ruins and on every
building all along the fighting front.</p>

<p>It was a dull day, with gray skies and mist and rain, but the weather
could not dampen the enthusiasm of the participants in the fête. It is
possible that the weather, however, had something to do with the
movements of the Germans, who had probably intended to launch their
offensive on the French national holiday, but for the storm. So the
attack they had been preparing against the Allies was made early in
the morning of the following day.</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page325" name="page325"></a>(p. 325)</span> CHAPTER XL</h2>

<p class="title">THE NEW GERMAN DRIVE AROUND RHEIMS&mdash;THE NEW BATTLE OF THE MARNE&mdash;THE
ALLIES LAUNCH A GREAT OFFENSIVE MOVEMENT</p>


<p>It was shortly after midnight on June 15, 1918, while in some parts of
the fighting front British, French, and Americans were still fêting
the national holiday, that the German guns from the Marne near
Château-Thierry heralded the new offensive. Soon along a front of
sixty miles, extending to the Argonne, the German artillery was
thundering. Men who had seen fighting since the war began describe the
artillery preparation for the drive as beyond anything the Germans had
attempted up to that time on the French front. Not only were the
Allies' lines front and back shelled, but behind the lines to a
distance of twenty and thirty miles.</p>

<p>About daybreak the German infantry attacked. East and west of Rheims a
large number of tanks assisted the advance. The French had already
anticipated the drive and were fully prepared. On the whole front east
of Rheims they held up the German hordes for five hours. It was only
in the neighborhood of the Souain Road and Prunay that the Germans
made any notable advance. Here on a narrow front they succeeded in
penetrating for about one and a half miles.</p>

<p>The most important achievement in the morning of the first day was the
crossing of the Marne of 15,000 German troops, and an advance of a
mile beyond on a ten-mile front.</p>

<p>East of Rheims, and east and west of Château-Thierry, American troops
received the full force of the German blows in those sectors. The
success of our soldiers in stemming the German advance is described in
detail in another place.</p>

<p class="smcap">The allied counteroffensive on the Marne. The shaded
part shows the gains of the allies.</p>
</div>

<p>In the first day's fighting the Germans employed fifty-six or
fifty-seven divisions of their best troops, fourteen on either side of
Rheims in the front line, and as many in the second line. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page327" name="page327"></a>(p. 327)</span>
General von Einem commanded in Champagne, Fritz von Below around
Rheims, and General von Boehm on the Marne.</p>

<p>By noon the Germans had begun to throw bridges across the Marne where
the river makes a salient northward with the point at Jaulgonne. Three
times the American guns shattered the pontoons that the Germans were
trying to throw across the river, but the fourth time they succeeded
in bridging the stream and made an advance of about two miles, the
Americans falling back to the base of the salient made by the river.</p>

<p>Comparative quiet reigned on the fighting fronts during the night
following the offensive. The only explanation of the Germans' failure
to push on must be attributed to their fear of failure. They had not
achieved the success they hoped for in the first onrush and their
losses had been far heavier than they anticipated.</p>

<p>From early dawn until dark on the second day of the German offensive
(July 16, 1918) the battle raged with unabated fury from
Château-Thierry to the Argonne, Southwest of Rheims the Germans
started a heavy drive, which they hoped would enable them to reach
Epernay, by pushing forward to St. Agnan, La Chapelle and Monthodon.
Here they were attacked in force by French and American troops and
driven out of the villages of St. Agnan and La Chapelle and from the
heights to the north dominating the Marne Valley at this point.</p>

<p>Where the battle front crossed the Marne south of Chatillon intense
fighting took place for the possession of Mareuil-le-Pont on the
southern bank of the river. General Pétain's troops were heavily
reenforced by Americans at this point, but the Germans were in
overwhelming numbers, and the Allies were forced to fall back fighting
every foot of the way to positions two miles southeast along the river
toward Epernay. Later in the day the Germans occupied Chatillon, which
marked some progress in the carrying out of their plan to flank Rheims
from the west.</p>

<p>Prunay, about five miles southeast of Rheims, was won by the Germans
from the French by a strong thrust. The French intrenched themselves
on the southern bank of the Vesle River and the enemy was unable to
make any further advance in this sector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name="page328"></a>(p. 328)</span> West of Rheims the Germans attacked in very considerable
strength at two places, by way of the Marne railway and in the region
south of Dormans. In this region they succeeded in throwing six
bridges across the Marne, between Reuilly and Dormans, but at no point
on this twenty-five-mile front did they succeed in penetrating more
than four miles into the French positions.</p>

<p>At the close of the second day of the offensive the Germans according
to their official report, claimed to have taken only 13,000 prisoners,
a small number indeed considering the large forces they had employed
in the advance. In the fighting around Prunay, where the struggle was
especially intense, they used up 65 per cent. of their effectives and
were forced to bring up reserves into the battle area, which they had
been holding back for later attacks.</p>

<p>The third day of the offensive (July 17, 1918) the fighting continued
along the whole front and ends, under rainy skies, and occasional
showers. The German gains in territory were unimportant except to the
southwest of Rheims, where they made an advance of about a mile and a
half. East and west of the martyred city most of their attacks were
broken up, and the whole Champagne line remained intact.</p>

<p>In the morning, Germans in a determined thrust broke through at
Oeuilly on the Marne and captured Montvoisin, seven miles west of
Epernay. In the regions west of this they were heavily reenforced by
fresh troops, but were unable to make any advance against the
magnificent defense of the French forces, who held them firmly on the
southern outskirts of Bouquigny and Chataignières. North of St. Agnan
the Germans were better favored by fortune, for they succeeded in
penetrating La Bourdonnerie. Here the French had the cooperation of
American troops and the enemy was held in check.</p>

<p>A decisive blow was struck by the Allies in the morning of July 18,
1918. The mighty counterattack was launched without any preliminary
artillery preparation, and proved to be a complete surprise to the
enemy. The drive was made on the twenty-eight-mile front from the
Aisne to the Marne and in the course <span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329"></a>(p. 329)</span> of the advance more than
twenty villages were captured and the Allies' lines were pushed to
within a mile of Soissons.</p>

<p>The ground regained at its extreme width was about six and a half
miles in the region to the south of Soissons. The attacking troops
drove forward as far east as the little river Crise, an advance
especially important, because it gave the Allies possession of high
ground that dominated the German supply lines to the city.</p>

<p>To the west of Soissons, American troops carried out successful
operations against the enemy, capturing over 4,000 prisoners, 30 guns,
and much war material. Farther south on the same side of the German
salient the Americans cooperating with French forces captured the town
of Vierzy and made an advance of three miles to the east of it.</p>

<p>North of the River Ourcq the Germans fought with desperate and
stubborn energy, but they were more than outmatched by the French, who
broke down their resistance and drove forward into the western
outskirts of Chouy and Neuilly-St. Front, and on to Belleau Wood, an
average depth of advance of about three miles.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the French and American effort will be appreciated
when it is understood that they had achieved more in this operation
than the Germans had accomplished in their hard drive on both sides of
Rheims. In six hours French and Americans working together had
advanced double the distance it had taken the Germans three days to
cover.</p>

<p>South of the Marne, the French lost some ground, but nowhere else
could the Germans make gains, while several of their attacks broke
down with appalling losses. Montvoisin, which the enemy had captured
on the previous day, was recovered by the French. Chêne-la-Réine was
also occupied to the west, and what was even more important, the
heights west of these villages overlooking the Marne. Other victories
of importance were won by the French north of the Marne, where they
captured the forest known as Bois du Rois and the village of Venteuil.</p>

<p>French and American forces continued their advance on July 19 between
the Aisne and the Marne, gaining ground of about two <span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>(p. 330)</span> miles at
some points. Since the drive of the Allies began 17,000 Germans had
been captured and 860 guns.</p>

<p>In a desperate attempt to stem the tide of the advance, the Germans
had brought great numbers of fresh troops into the fighting area. The
plateau southwest of Soissons in the Crise River region, which the
Germans lost on the previous day, was the scene of an intense and
bitterly fought struggle. Despite the Germans' determined efforts to
regain the plateau, the Allies firmly held their positions, and in the
afternoon began a further advance.</p>

<p>To the south the Germans were driven from the plateau northwest of
Bonnes, but not before they had fought with determined resistance that
was deserving of better fortune. Progress was also made by the Allies
southwest of Rheims, where the French and Italians fought together.</p>

<p>The British, who had so far been spared in the recent German
offensive, had a small victory to their credit on the same day (July
19, 1918) that the French, Americans, and Italians were pushing back
the enemy all along the front. Meteren, a valuable observation point
in the Bailleul sector, was captured by Scottish and Australian
troops. Four hundred Germans were taken and a number of machine guns.</p>

<p>Heavy fighting was resumed late in the afternoon of July 19, 1918,
along the Aisne-Marne front. The French were fighting uphill, but the
Germans could not keep them back, and were slowly pushed out of their
strongest positions in this region.</p>

<p>The large numbers of fresh troops thrown into the battle to support
the crown prince made it necessary for the French to fight every foot
of the way. On a twenty-eight-mile front the average advance of the
Allies was only one mile, and they fought hard from noon on July 19,
1918, to 9 o'clock on the following morning to accomplish this.</p>

<p>The Germans, violently attacked on their right flank and south of the
Marne, were forced to retreat and recross the river. The whole
southern bank of the Marne was now in French possession.</p>

<p>In the three days' fighting the Allies had captured over 20,000
prisoners and over 400 guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page331" name="page331"></a>(p. 331)</span> On the following morning the Allies resumed the offensive,
forcing the Germans to give way gradually on both sides of the deep
pocket of which Rheims and Soissons mark the edges. In this pocket the
Germans suffered heavy casualties from the long-range guns and
airplane bombers of the Allies.</p>

<p>Château-Thierry was occupied by French and American troops on July 21,
1918, the Germans evacuating the place under strong pressure. In their
withdrawal from that pivot point on the Marne salient they were
closely followed by the Allies' forces, who, cooperating with troops
at Vaux and to the northward, swept the Germans back for miles, and
beyond the highway to Soissons.</p>

<p>Farther north and almost reaching to Soissons, French and American
forces drove on to the Soissons-Château-Thierry highway at Hartennes,
and gaining the railway under the Allied guns, threatened Oulchy. As a
result of these operations the entire front was straightened out and
a gain was made of over seven miles of territory.</p>

<p>On the east side of the salient, between Rheims and the Marne, French
and British troops fighting shoulder to shoulder were driving back the
Germans, who, opposing a strong resistance, and supported by reserves,
were unable to stem the Allies' advance. In the course of the fighting
in this sector the French and British occupied the village of Bouilly.</p>

<p>The heavy artillery of the Allies continued on July 21, 1918, to
hammer German positions in the districts north of the Marne. Indian
scouts who were with Pershing in Mexico were active in gathering
information in the river region.</p>

<p>In all sections of the line, from Soissons to Rheims, the hard
struggle continued with undiminished intensity. Although the Germans
maintained a desperate resistance at the bottom of the Marne salient,
it was evident that they would be forced soon to make a wide retreat.
This was indicated by the great concentration of German troops at the
top of the salient which could only mean that they were making
preparations to retire to a new line.</p>

<p>The entire Château-Thierry-Soissons highway from the Ourcq south was
now occupied by the Allies. Epieds was captured and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page332" name="page332"></a>(p. 332)</span> territory
gained northeast of Mont St. Père, and east of La Croix, and
Griselles. Near the last place named the Germans gained some slight
temporary advantage, but it had no effect on the continued advance the
Allies were making.</p>

<p>Having cleared the Germans out of the district south of the Marne, the
Allies were busy constructing bridges and getting troops and supplies
across the river. On July 22, 1918, the enemy were trying to keep a
hold on the river bank extending from Mont St. Père to east of
Reuilly. In the face of a furious fire the French succeeded in getting
two strong bodies of troops across the stream at Mézy and Courcelles,
who at once started the construction of footbridges while under the
grilling fire of the German guns.</p>

<p>The Allies continued to make progress in the Soissons-Rheims salient
on July 23, 1918, although the Germans with the support of fresh
troops developed stubborn resistance. The most important operation of
the day was the advance of the French forces on both sides of the
Ourcq southward toward Fère-en-Tardenois, the great German supply
center. North of the river General Pétain's troops occupied Montgru on
the bank of the stream and two other towns.</p>

<p>South of the Ourcq the Allies were even more successful in gaining
ground. Here the French and Americans, cooperating, drove the Germans
back nearly a mile beyond the Château-Thierry-Soissons road.
Meanwhile, in the Montdidier sector, Foch struck a hard blow at the
enemy and achieved a brilliant success. The French troops, attacking
on a four-mile front north of Montdidier, made a forward drive of two
miles, capturing Mailly-Raineval, Savillers, and Aulvillers. The
heights commanding the Avre River were also won, and over 1,500
Germans were captured.</p>

<p>At other points, notably east and northeast of Château-Thierry, at the
bottom of the great salient, the French troops, ably assisted by
American forces, gained ground. Along almost the entire line between
the Ourcq and the Marne German resistance was broken by the resistless
onward sweep of the Franco-American forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333"></a>(p. 333)</span> During the night of July 23-24, 1918, the Germans delivered a
terrific counterattack in the neighborhood of Epieds, where they were
opposed by American troops. The Germans succeeded after a hard fight
in recapturing the village, and another in the neighborhood, but they
were unable to hold their gains. On the following day the Americans
drove them out of these villages and pushed on beyond Courpoil, more
than a mile to the northeast.</p>

<p>North of this fighting area French troops had penetrated as far as
Brecy, while to the southeast French and American troops drove forward
through the woods on a wide front beyond Preloup on the Marne. The
advance of the Allies at several points was about two miles.</p>

<p>The Germans had nearly half a million troops concentrated in the
Marne salient. Attacked on three sides by British, French, and
American forces, their position was extremely perilous. To continue
resistance in a position so threatened might appear to be an act of
madness, yet it was a maxim of Napoleon's that, where forces are about
equal, the inside fighters have the advantage over an adversary in
concentric formation.</p>

<p>The Allies continued to bend in the salient, the French and Americans
on the west, and the French and British on the east. The most
important point held by the Germans, and the Allies' main objective,
was Fère-en-Tardenois, the junction of several roads, and a chief
distributing point.</p>

<p>This nerve center of the German front, subjected to constant cross
fire from French and American guns, was fast becoming untenable.
Indeed there was no corner of the salient where the Germans were not
constantly harried by the artillery of the Allies.</p>

<p>The most important gain made by the Franco-American forces on July 25,
1918, was below the Ourcq River. In the course of this advance the
Allies captured Hill 141 southeast of Armentières, and the village of
Coincy on the south, and pushing ahead in a northeasterly direction
they occupied most of Tournelle Wood, which is only three miles from
Fère-en-Tardenois. Farther to the south an advance was made as far as
the forest of Fère and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>(p. 334)</span> to the general line of
Beuvardes-Charmel. Ground was also gained north of Dormans on the
Meuse.</p>

<p>As a result of these advances the Allies had taken about forty miles
of territory from the Germans, and had acquired almost a straight line
running southeast from Armentières to Vincelles, on the Marne.</p>

<p>In the sector west of Rheims, British and French troops had advanced
to Guex and Mery-Premecy, which meant a push of two miles in the
direction of Fismes, and the narrowing of the mouth of the salient to
that extent.</p>

<p>Ten divisions of reserves had been rushed to the aid of the German
crown prince, drawn from the army of Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria in
the course of the week's fighting, but the new forces were unable to
stay the victorious advance of the Allies.</p>

<p>As the result of the last week's operations the whole situation on
the western front was transformed. The Germans had used up sixty-five
divisions on the Champagne front and all of the crown prince's
reserves. They had only about thirty divisions left belonging to
Prince Rupprecht's Army to draw on.</p>

<p>The Germans were certainly in an awkward situation, but it was no
worse than that which confronted the British Army in the Ypres salient
before the capture of Messines Ridge. The Ypres salient was about five
miles wide, and five miles deep, and the German guns commanded it. The
German salient was at this time about twenty miles wide by twenty
deep, and the artillery of the Allies could sweep every corner of it.</p>

<p>From documents captured from the Germans, it was learned that on the
day after the Allies assumed the offensive a retirement was ordered to
a line either along the Avre or the Vesle Rivers. These orders were
subsequently canceled, because an orderly retreat could not be made in
such a pinched salient, so the Germans had been commanded to maintain
their positions as long as possible.</p>

<p>Unable to further withstand the tremendous pressure of the Allies'
armies, the Germans began a retreat along the whole front north of the
Marne late in the morning of July 27, 1918. They relinquished the
strong grip they had held on the north bank of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335"></a>(p. 335)</span> the river,
which extended from Vincelles nearly ten miles east to Reuil, and also
fell back on both flanks.</p>

<p>It was the purpose of the Germans to reach the Ourcq, on a line
reaching from Fère-en-Tardenois to the northern top of the De Riz
forest which lies before Charmel.</p>

<p>In the course of the day the French, British, and American troops,
pressing hard on the heels of the German rear guards, had reached the
line of Bruyères, Villeneuve-sur-Fère, and Courment, all within a few
miles of the great German supply center of Fère-en-Tardenois, which
was now so hemmed in that its evacuation must soon follow. The advance
of the Allies in a northeasterly direction from Château-Thierry had
now reached ten miles. Since the beginning of the counteroffensive
30,000 German prisoners were taken.</p>

<p>The Allies continued their triumphant progress on July 28, 1918. The
Germans in the Soissons-Rheims salient were forced to accelerate the
speed of their retirement northward, closely followed by tanks,
cavalry, and infantry patrols of the Allies.</p>

<p>French cavalry, supported by some infantry elements, had, reached in
the morning of July 28, 1918, the district south of Villers-sur-Fère,
a little over a mile from Fère-en-Tardenois and Sergy.</p>

<p>The success of the Allies along the whole front was now complete and
about half of the pocket in which the enemy had been cornered was
retaken.</p>

<p>The Germans were retiring as swiftly as they could, but their losses
were tremendous, as French and American troops harried them on the
center, and French and British were dealing hammer blows on both of
their flanks. While the cavalry were hard at it, the tanks had pushed
their way in among the retreating forces, where they did effective
work. The Allies' aviators meanwhile, flying a few hundred feet
overhead, were machine-gunning columns on the march and bombarding
German batteries.</p>

<p>In the Soissons area the Germans had massed a large number of heavy
guns on the heights around Juvigny and Chavigny, and from these points
they bombarded the western wing as far south as Oulchy-le-Château. Yet
the Allies in the Oulchy region <span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>(p. 336)</span> continued to make progress,
though facing some of the finest German divisions, and the
concentrated fire of a vast number of machine guns.</p>

<p>On the eastern wing the Allies were gradually gaining control of the
whole road leading from Dormans to Rheims. The Germans had assembled
on this side a strong array of artillery near St. Thierry, which
served to protect their left flank, and which delayed, though it could
not stop, the Allies' advance.</p>

<p>The German retreat, it should be noted, was conducted in an orderly
manner and was in no sense a rout. The method of retirement employed
at this time, and which the Germans indeed adopted on other occasions,
was as follows: One company withdraws from every two on the first
line; the remaining troops redouble their fire to give the impression
that the line is still strongly held. Out of each remaining company
two sections are then taken out, leaving but one section in the line.
When this last section is ordered to withdraw, a few men are left
behind to occupy small posts well furnished with machine guns and
these keep up a vigorous fire to protect the retreat. The few men left
behind for this work seldom escape death or capture, but they are
sometimes able to regain their own lines.</p>

<p>The retreat continued on July 29, 1918, with the Allies in close
pursuit. The Germans had brought more heavy guns into play and
succeeded in slowing up the advance, though they could not stop it. In
the course of twenty-four hours the Allies had pushed their lines
forward from two to three miles on a twenty-mile front. The Germans
had been forced to abandon the line of the Ourcq and proposed to fall
back to a line beyond the Vesle between Soissons and Rheims.</p>

<p>One of the most important operations at this time was the French drive
east and northeast, from the neighborhood of Oulchy-le-Château, at the
salient in the German line, which opened the way for the advance of
the Allies to Fère-en-Tardenois and beyond. Grand Rozoy and the
heights to the north of it were occupied and also Cugny, which stands
one mile east of Oulchy. Farther north of Grand Rozoy the troops of
General Pétain were pushing forward to capture the hills that
dominated a wide <span class="pagenum"><a id="page337" name="page337"></a>(p. 337)</span> area north and south. In these operations
the French captured nearly 500 Germans.</p>

<p>The fighting around Sergy on the north bank of the Ourcq was of a
specially violent character, the place changing hands no less than
nine times in twenty-four hours. Here, where the Americans had only
the assistance from the French of a few armored cars, they fought
practically "on their own" with distinction and bravery. (Details of
their achievements in this struggle are noted in another place.)</p>

<p>To the east, and just north of the Ourcq, the Allies won possession of
the villages of Vallée and Givray. Toward Soissons a hard fight was in
progress for the possession of Buzancy. It had twice been won by the
Allies and then the Germans captured it. New Scottish troops, aided by
a few British columns, attacked the town and it was won for the
Allies.</p>

<p>After defeating the Prussian Guards and Bavarians, the American forces
made an advance of two miles beyond Sergy on July 30, 1918. The German
resistance to the Allies' thrusts now became increasingly vigorous.
Along almost the entire front to the east they launched fierce
counterattacks, but only succeeded in gaining a little ground near St.
Euphraise to the southwest of Rheims.</p>

<p>The main advance of the Allies on the westerly side of the front was
near Grand Rozoy, where the French were pushing north to the crest of
the plateau between the Vesle and the Ourcq.</p>

<p>The intense struggle which had continued without pause for two weeks
on the Marne battle front now showed signs of slackening. The only
fighting worthy of note took place in the Fère region, on the front
held by American troops around Seringes and Sergy. Here the Germans
made a hard fight during the night and morning of July 30-31, 1918, to
dislodge the forces of General Pershing, but were badly beaten.
(Details of the struggle are described on another page.)</p>

<p>The hope of the Germans that the Allies were in a state of exhaustion,
and that the offensive had broken down for the present, was rudely
shattered on the first of August, 1918. On this date the Allies
attacked on a ten-mile front from Buzancy to Fère-en-Tardenois
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>(p. 338)</span> and Seringes. They drove forward nearly two miles at one
point, and carried important heights, including Hill 205 north of
Grand Rozoy, which resulted in wiping out the angle of the battle line
east of Oulchy.</p>

<p>Where the Allies marked their greatest advance was in the region
northwest of Fère-en-Tardenois. The villages of Cramoiselle and
Cramaille were occupied, as well as Bordeux to the north, and Servenay
to the northeast. As a result of this thrust the victors captured 600
prisoners. In the course of the operations from July 15 to July 31,
1918, the Allies had taken 34,400 Germans.</p>

<p>These successful operations on the Buzancy-Fère front, carried out by
French forces with the support of British units at the north, linked
up the gains made by the Americans on the previous day and night in
the area east and southeast of Seringes.</p>

<p>Farther to the east in the Ville-en-Tardenois region, on the left
flank of the fast decreasing German salient, French forces, after an
especially murderous and close struggle, drove the enemy out of the
village of Romigny and occupied the place.</p>

<p>Apart from the important gains in territory made by the Allies in the
two weeks' offensive operations, the result of the victories was to
shake the belief of the German army in their own invincibility. They
had failed in their objectives, first in the thrust toward Rheims, and
afterward in their efforts to hold out against a counterassault. Twice
they had made determined and exhaustive attempts with large forces of
men to stem the advance of the Allies, and had failed in each
instance. They had employed their best troops, who fought with courage
and daring and with reckless disregard for life, but were unable to
build a barrier that the Allies could not shatter. It was not believed
by the Allied High Command that the morale of the German fighters had
been seriously sapped by their forced retreat, but the news would
drift back to Germany in soldiers' letters and in other ways, creating
a feeling in the Empire that their army was not equal to its task, and
a consequent loss of faith in the flamboyant promises of victory
proclaimed by Hindenburg and Ludendorff.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XLI</h2>

<p class="title">FORCE TO THE UTMOST</p>


<p>Only the sword could impose peace. The kaiser said it. His
mouthpieces, Count von Hertling and Count Czernin, said it, by way of
buttressing much verbal camouflage conveying that their peoples would
like peace by gentler means&mdash;that is, by the Allies yielding.
Lloyd-George said it without camouflage. But it was left to President
Wilson to say it with finality. Despairing of drawing from the Central
Powers any lucid declaration to show that they were honorable
opponents with whom honorable enemies could negotiate, he swept aside
German chicanery by leaving no loophole open for the determination of
the war by any other means than the sword. Germany had slammed the
door of peace in her own face.</p>

<p>Hark the kaiser, accepting an address in Hamburg, in February, 1918,
on the conclusion of peace with the Ukraine:</p>

<p>"He who will not accept peace, but on the contrary declines, pouring
out the blood of his own and of our people, must be forced to have
peace. We desire to live in friendship with neighboring peoples, but
the victory of German arms must first be recognized. Our troops under
the great Hindenburg will continue to win it. Then peace will come."</p>

<p>The dissembling ministers of Germany and Austria, in essaying public
debates with President Wilson, tried to build a fabric of peace on a
foundation of sand. In their utterances they <span class="pagenum"><a id="page340" name="page340"></a>(p. 340)</span> "played up" to
one another. Their outgivings suggested a vaudeville act in which one
player provides cues for the witticisms of the other. Thus, Count
Czernin, dense to the Allied scorn of the deceits of his partner,
Count von Hertling, announced that Austria, too, agreed that President
Wilson's four points provided a suitable basis on which to begin
negotiating a general peace. More than that, he complacently viewed
President Wilson's address as actually offering an olive branch to
Austria:</p>

<p>"He (President Wilson)," he told the Vienna City Council, "thinks,
however, that Vienna presents more favorable soil for sowing the seeds
of a general peace. He has perhaps said to himself that the
Austro-Hungarian Monarchy has the good fortune to have a monarch who
genuinely and honorably desires a general peace, but that this monarch
will never be guilty of a breach of faith; that he will never make a
shameful peace, and that behind this monarch stand 55,000,000 souls.</p>

<p>"I imagine that Mr. Wilson says to himself that this closely knit mass
of people represents a force which is not to be disregarded and that
this honorable and firm will to peace with which the monarch is imbued
and which binds him to the peoples of both states is capable of
carrying a great idea in the service of which Mr. Wilson has also
placed himself."</p>

<p>No one believed, outside the countries of the Central Powers, that
Austria-Hungary was blessed with a monarch who would "never be guilty
of a breach of faith," who would "never make a shameful peace," and
who ruled over a "closely knit mass of people." In the same breath he
said:</p>

<p>"Whatever may happen, we shall not sacrifice German interests any more
than Germany will desert us. Loyalty on the Danube is not less than
German loyalty."</p>

<p>Here was the real Austria speaking, and her spirit was made more
manifest when Count Czernin proceeded to defend the political crime of
thrusting peace upon Russia by invasion:</p>

<p>"The first breach in the determination of our enemies to war has been
driven by the peace negotiations with Russia. That was a break-through
by the idea of peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>(p. 341)</span> "It is a symptom of childish dilettantism to overlook the
close relationship of the various peace signatures with each other.
The constellation of enemy powers in the east was like a net. When one
mesh was cut through the remaining meshes loosened of their own
accord."</p>

<p>Austria plainly wanted peace, but by negotiation, since it was dawning
upon the Teutonic powers that they could never effect a peace by force
of arms. Wouldn't President Wilson kindly open negotiations without
delay? But Germany and Austria must be left with the whole vast east
under their control. Apparently Count Czernin was willfully blind to
the fact that the terms of peace forced upon Russia and Rumania had
closed all avenues of peace in the countries of the Allies.</p>

<p>President Wilson cleared the air. Peace conversations in the world
arena with the German chancellor and the Austrian foreign minister had
reached a hopeless stage of sterility. They spoke smooth words; their
military leaders committed rapacious deeds that made their words an
object-lesson in studied irony. On April 6, 1918, the anniversary of
America's entrance into the war, the President took occasion to bring
about a very decided turning point in the diplomacy of the war. It was
a world-stirring declaration, made at Baltimore to inaugurate the
campaign for the Third Liberty Loan, and told the Teutonic powers that
their arduous and ever-recurrent peace propaganda had killed itself.</p>

<p>"... I have sought to learn from those who spoke for Germany," he
said, "whether it was justice or dominion and the execution of their
own will upon the other nations of the world that the German leaders
were seeking. They have answered&mdash;answered in unmistakable terms. They
have avowed that it was not justice, but dominion and the unhindered
execution of their own will. The avowal has not come from Germany's
statesmen. It has come from her military leaders, who are her real
rulers....</p>

<p>"We cannot mistake what they have done&mdash;in Russia, in Finland, in the
Ukraine, in Rumania. The real test of their justice and fair play has
come. From this we may judge the rest....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page342" name="page342"></a>(p. 342)</span> "Their purpose is, undoubtedly, to make all the Slavic
peoples, all the free and ambitious nations of the Baltic Peninsula,
all the lands that Turkey has dominated and misruled, subject to their
will and ambition, and build upon that dominion an empire of force
upon which they fancy that they can then erect an empire of gain and
commercial supremacy&mdash;an empire as hostile to the Americas as to the
Europe which it will overawe&mdash;an empire which will ultimately master
Persia, India, and the peoples of the Far East....</p>

<p>"That program once carried out, America and all who care or dare to
stand with her must arm and prepare themselves to contest the mastery
of the world&mdash;a mastery in which the rights of common men, the rights
of women and of all who are weak, must for the time being be trodden
underfoot and disregarded and the old, age-long struggle for freedom
and right begin again at its beginning. Everything that America has
lived for and loved and grown great to vindicate and bring to a
glorious realization will have fallen in utter ruin and the gates of
mercy once more pitilessly shut upon mankind!</p>

<p>"The thing is preposterous and impossible; and yet is not that what
the whole course and action of the German armies has meant wherever
they have moved? I do not wish, even in this moment of utter
disillusionment, to judge harshly or unrighteously. I judge only what
the German arms have accomplished with unpitying thoroughness
throughout every fair region they have touched.</p>

<p>"What, then, are we to do? For myself, I am ready, ready still, ready
even now, to discuss a fair and just and honest peace at any time that
it is sincerely purposed&mdash;a peace in which the strong and the weak
shall fare alike. But the answer, when I proposed such a peace, came
from the German commanders in Russia and I cannot mistake the meaning
of the answer.</p>

<p>"I accept the challenge. I know that you accept it. All the world
shall know that you can accept it....</p>

<p>"Germany has once more said that force, and force alone, shall decide
whether justice and peace shall reign in the affairs of men, whether
right as America conceives it or dominion as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page343" name="page343"></a>(p. 343)</span> she conceives it
shall determine the destinies of mankind. There is, therefore, but one
response possible from us:</p>

<p>"<i>Force, force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the
righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the
world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust!</i>"</p>

<p>Germany only recognized physical force; no other force counted.
President Wilson, in countering, set at its true measure the might of
the United States, joined with the might of the other active
belligerents, Great Britain, France, and Italy.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XLII</h2>

<p class="title">THE AMERICAN LEGIONS</p>


<p>When the German spring offensive of 1918 came and hewed a great dent
in the western front, the cry went up from the Allied capitals for
American aid. "Hurry!" entreated Lloyd-George. "Hurry!" came the echo
from Paris. Then, almost like an answering echo, was heard the tramp
of American legions on the soil of France. Week after week, through
the spring and summer, United States troops spread their columns
fanwise from their ports of debarkation, until their multiplying
presence was felt, where not seen, along the entire fighting line from
the Belgian coast to the Swiss frontier.</p>

<p>Another army had preceded them, armed with picks and shovels, trowels
and axes. It was an army of tool chests, building gear and rails. More
than one western port of France, slumbering in its ancient ways, had
to be transformed, to give proper entrance to the shiploads of
soldiers from the New World, with their mountainous equipment, and new
roads had to be cut through France to convey them to the front. One
regiment was of foresters, with knocked-down sawmills, who went into
the woods of France to cut down trees and shape them into timbers for
building large docks. Another corps of advance guards were the
American engineers, later organized into <span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344"></a>(p. 344)</span> five regiments and
nineteen battalions, all engaged in railroad construction and
operation to facilitate the movement of American troops. So with new
and spacious gateways, which transformed the restricted port
facilities of the French coast towns, and with huge warehouses,
ordnance depots and barracks neighboring the new docks, the American
troops found an ingress on French soil and accommodation for
themselves and their leviathan equipment in keeping with the vast
scheme of warfare that represented American belligerency.</p>

<p>From the French ports ran a double line of railroad which was extended
by American army engineers to the battle front. The use of these
preexisting lines for American troops called for the additional
construction of hundreds of miles of trackage for yards, sidings, and
switches. Thus was called into being the United States Military
Railroad in France. It started from the seaport terminals, with their
new docks verdant with the rawness of fresh-cut timber, with their
tipples and cranes and wharf houses and warehouses, and spread over a
mass of tracks that meandered and forked into division yards, curved
on to divergent lines or connected with light railways at the fighting
front some 600 miles distant.</p>

<p>With new ports and new railroad systems virtually constructed for
their passage, the American troops moved to their allotted places at
the front under conditions that gave their journey an uncommon éclat.
They were sorely needed, for one thing, and, for another, preexisting
port and transit facilities did not suffice to bear them to their
destination. A new path had to be blazed for the armed entrée of the
New World into the Old World.</p>

<p class="smcap">Military establishments in the United States.</p>
</div>

<p>The gateways widened as each shipload grew in numbers and frequency.
The beginning of the overseas movement was slow; the United States
stumbled through weary-dragging months before its awakened militancy
got into its stride in spanning the ocean. In May, 1917, the month
following the American declaration of war, only 1,718 officers and men
landed; in June, 12,261; July, 12,988; August, 18,323; September,
32,523; October, 38,259; November, 23,016; December, 48,840. The
beginning of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page346" name="page346"></a>(p. 346)</span> 1918 brought no perceptible expansion, the
number of troops sent in January and February, 1918, being only 46,776
and 48,027, respectively. But with the spring came indications of the
accumulating force of American preparations. In March the number sent
across was 83,811; in April, 117,212; in May, 244,345; in June,
276,372, and in July, 300,000. Marines numbering 14,644 were also
dispatched. So by July 31, 1918, American forces in France had reached
the impressive figure of 1,319,115.</p>

<p>Meantime the troops were vaguely heard of as fighting in five
different sectors along the western front, one detachment as far east
as the Swiss border. Later they had spread to eight sectors, namely,
near Montdidier, northwest of Château-Thierry, immediately east of
Château-Thierry, at Toul, in Lorraine, and three in Alsace, one near
the border line, another south of that, and one in front of Belfort.</p>

<p>The German spring offensive had sensibly stimulated the shipment of
troops, as the figures showed. That offense had its critical stages
toward the close of March, which made the help of American troops more
and more urgent. General Pershing interposed with an offer to the
British and French Governments to place all the American troops and
facilities then in France at their disposal to help stay the German
advance. The proposal deeply stirred the Anglo-French ranks&mdash;and the
inactive American troops no less&mdash;and evoked grateful acknowledgments
from London and Paris.</p>

<p>Presently American troops were heard of further afield&mdash;in Italy, for
service under General Diaz against the Austrians. Tidings of their
presence at a still more remote corner of the battle area came in the
announcement that American marines, cooperating with British forces,
had occupied a part of the Murman coast of the White Sea in European
Russia.</p>

<p>The Stars and Stripes fluttered over Europe at far-flung points. On
the western front an American army had grown up, and was rated as
competent to perform the hardest work of war&mdash;to stand an intensive
bombardment, to repel the assaults of massed infantry, or to launch
counterattacks. Its achievements will be subsequently related; but
even if they did not rank <span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347"></a>(p. 347)</span> in numbers with those of the
British and French, the mere presence of American soldiers at the
forefront of one of the world's greatest battles stood out as a
transcendent historical event. The forces of the New World had
appeared to save liberty in Europe. They were there to establish a
reorganization of the world on the American plan&mdash;not for the glory of
the Stars and Stripes, but for a vindication of the ideas which the
flag represented.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XLIII</h2>

<p class="title">RAIDING THE NEW FOE</p>


<p>American activities had hitherto been confined to what became known as
the original American front, facing Lorraine beyond St. Mihiel. This
was apparently an irregular line, in the vicinity of the Rhine-Marne
canal, and fronting Nancy, Lunéville, Toul, and other towns whose
existence became known by General Pershing's reports.</p>

<p>It was their "breaking in" ground. American troops there obtained an
intimate acquaintance with modern warfare. The numerous trench raids
that marked their operations apparently had no strategical relations
to the movements on the battle line elsewhere, nor even disclosed any
local tactical object. Americans and Germans seemed merely to be
watching each other with lynx eyes, each on the alert to catch the
other napping and steal a march for the glory of the achievement.</p>

<p>The casualties in these skirmishes were usually slight, and a few
prisoners now and then would fall to one or the other side. But few
raids took place without losses, which gradually became impressive as
the engagements increased in frequency and scope. A trench raid is a
trivial thing, with an inconsequential outcome when it has any outcome
at all; but repeated daily, the casualties such raids produce, added
to the fatalities resulting from random artillery fire, assume the
dimensions of those of an extensive battle. They do not stand out as
distinctive operations; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page348" name="page348"></a>(p. 348)</span> proceeding upon established methods,
there was a general sameness in their repetition, and they only became
noticeable for the outstanding incidents that were bound to arise in
each undertaking.</p>

<p>An early attack by the Germans was made behind a dense fog after
daybreak, through which came a violent artillery barrage as a
forerunner. The fog was of a density that blotted out everything but
the nearest enemy positions. Through it enemy projectiles exploded on
three sides of an American listening post just outside the wire,
within forty-five feet of an enemy listening post. In a few minutes
hundreds of high-explosive shells had dropped round the post and the
surrounding ground, cutting off the men there. American artillery
replied; but all traces of German dead and wounded were removed by the
time the Americans had emerged from their dugouts after their barrage
was raised.</p>

<p>The Germans followed their sortie against the listening post by a
heavy bombardment of the American lines a few days later. American
guns responded, shell for shell, wrecking several of the enemy's
dugouts, and badly damaging some of his first-line positions. They
were caved in by the American 75's, and the Germans spent several days
in repairing them and patching up gaps in the barbed wire before the
wrecked trenches could be reoccupied. A number of the men who were
wounded slightly by shell splinters were treated in the lines with
their first-aid packets and insisted on remaining at their posts until
the fight was finished.</p>

<p>The enemy's next artillery exercise was a concentrated fire on one of
the American positions with the object of obliterating it. Americans
guns at once punished the German batteries with a retaliatory fire of
double force, and then swept the enemy lines with a vicious barrage.
Whereupon the German guns ceased firing.</p>

<p>The enemy presently resorted to the use of gas to harass the American
positions. Aimed at a wood, a rain of shells, largely composed of gas
and high explosives, came from the German minenwerfers. They burst in
the air, the high explosives detonating <span class="pagenum"><a id="page349" name="page349"></a>(p. 349)</span> when they came in
contact with the earth, and broke into fragments among a number of men
before they could adjust their masks. Other troops were overcome by
the fumes while asleep in their dugouts. The fumes lingered in the
gassed area long after the shells had exploded, filling shell holes
and other depressions, and incapacitating men who ventured to work in
the vicinity. But the American guns exacted swift retribution. They
leveled a heavy fire on the German minenwerfers, and in half an hour
had razed the position. Timbers were thrown high in the air, and
explosions, probably of enemy ammunition, testified to American
marksmanship. The ground about the German batteries was churned upside
down, and there was no doubt of the fate of any German soldiers who
were on the spot.</p>

<p>The beginning of March, 1918, saw the first pitched battle between
Americans and Germans in the St. Mihiel salient north of Toul. The
enemy started it by a morning raid in a driving wet snow, preceded by
heavy gunfire, intermixed with poison gas. The latter was discharged
on the trenches in a generous hail of shells, the Germans evidently
thinking that this second cloud of gas would daunt the American troops
after their previous foretaste. The Americans were not daunted; their
masks quickly covered them, and few troops were affected.</p>

<p>The woods behind the salient were shot to pieces by the German fire.
As soon as the barrage was raised on the trenches to the right of the
salient, some 300 Germans swept forward under the protection of their
fire. They jumped into what was left of the trenches, expecting to
make a haul of prisoners; but they found the Americans ready for them.</p>

<p>A fierce hand-to-hand fight followed in front of wire entanglements
and in shell holes. Meantime American barrage fire swept
no-man's-land, catching many running Germans who had turned tail from
fighting at close quarters.</p>

<p>The Germans were thrown back, leaving ten dead in the American
trenches. Two were officers, entangled in the wire. The ground was
littered with enemy hand grenades, boxes of explosives for destroying
dugouts, and incendiary bombs the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350"></a>(p. 350)</span> enemy had no opportunity of
using. The enemy had paid dearly for his enterprise, but the Americans
also suffered in proportion. Berlin claimed that twelve had been
captured.</p>

<p>They had cut the American wire with caution, making no noise, but the
sentry was watching their performance all the time, and let them
proceed until he was sure of routing them.</p>

<p>Another American patrol experienced, for the first time, a German
attack of liquid fire. Enemy troops were about to throw flame
projectors into the American trenches when an American patrol near by
opened fire on them. The Germans fled precipitately, pursued by the
Americans, and dropped four projectors, two of which were flaming. All
the projectors had been punctured by American shots.</p>

<p>The foregoing series of engagements shows that in every case the
Germans were the aggressors. The Americans, in fact, were merely
holding the Lorraine sector without aspiring to take the field until
they were better acquainted with trench warfare. The Germans,
believing they had green troops before them, were accordingly
venturesome, and disposed to put them on their mettle, which they
accordingly did, only to find that the supposedly raw American troops
were no longer raw. The Germans themselves had contributed to ridding
them of any greenness with which they credited them. The Americans had
occupied the Lorraine sector as substitutes for the French, and the
Germans were accordingly eager to know the quality of their new
antagonists. Hence these series of raids made on the American front.
Soon the tables were to be turned by the Americans conducting raids of
their own.</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page351" name="page351"></a>(p. 351)</span> CHAPTER XLIV</h2>

<p class="title">AMERICA OVER THE TOP</p>


<p>The first direct attack on the German lines made by American forces in
the Lorraine sector took place on the night of March 9, 1918, with the
cooperation of the French. Two raids were made. The troops engaged
were ordered to cut off the two ends of a salient in the German line,
flatten out the salient by artillery fire, enter the trenches, bomb
the dugouts, sweep the trenches generally, and return.</p>

<p>Intense artillery fire, lasting four hours, leveled the German
positions before the Franco-American troops advanced. They were
divided into two forces, with small French detachments flanking each,
and went forward at midnight behind a creeping barrage, each on a
front of six hundred yards. Starting simultaneously, one advanced
northwest of the salient, the other to the northeast. On the German
first lines being reached, the barrage was lifted so as to box in the
enemy positions at both points.</p>

<p>The troops dropped into the trenches, expecting a hand-to-hand fight,
but found that the Germans had fled. Continuing, they reached the
second German line six hundred yards farther on while American machine
guns fired on each flank of the two parties to check flanking
operations by the enemy.</p>

<p>The yield in prisoners was poor, the Germans having decamped. One
French flanking party found two wounded Germans. The Americans found
none. But they blew up a number of excellent concrete dugouts and
returned with large quantities of material and valuable papers. While
they were in the vacated German lines, enemy artillery began a
vigorous counterbarrage, but it was quickly silenced by gas shells
hurled by American heavy and light guns.</p>

<p>The raid was followed by a second on another part of the line,
undertaken without the aid of the French. A preliminary bombardment
swept the Germans' front trenches, tearing gaps in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page352" name="page352"></a>(p. 352)</span> their
barbed-wire entanglements, and wrought other destruction. The German
batteries came into action, but accomplished nothing to halt the
American progress. Entering the German trenches behind one side of a
"box" barrage, which moved forward in front of them, they found
numerous Germans hiding in the dugouts. Hand-to-hand fighting
followed, the Americans using their automatic pistols and rifles. They
penetrated 300 yards of the enemy line, going beyond their objective.
More fighting developed, but the Germans were not equal to the assault
and fled, leaving a number of dead and wounded in their trenches. The
Americans fought so fast in effecting their object that the army
doctors who accompanied them had little to do. They returned to their
own lines without being impeded by a single German shell, and without
fatalities. It was all over so quickly that the German batteries had
no chance to get into real action. It was just a fifteen-minute
adventure undertaken by way of feeling their way in testing their
capacity to give the Germans a taste of their own medicine.</p>

<p>Following these engagements, the actual locality of which was not
disclosed, American forces were reported to be very active in
aggressive operations in the neighborhood of Lunéville, a town east of
the Toul sector. This information revealed an extension of the
American positions in Lorraine and an augmentation of forces that made
the new sector one of the most active on the front. It appeared that
the two simultaneous raids mentioned took place in this vicinity,
northwest and northeast of Badonviller. The trenches evacuated by the
Germans were occupied by the Americans, who consolidated them with
their own lines. This forward movement, though a small one, marked the
first permanent advance by the American army in France, and enabled
the Americans and French to operate from higher ground than
heretofore. The Germans made only feeble attempts to retake the
position, and each time were repulsed. The parapets were turned toward
the enemy, dugout entrances were changed, and new dugouts built to
protect the troops. An exploring patrol examined the trenches,
proceeding laterally until they established contact with the enemy.
They came upon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page353" name="page353"></a>(p. 353)</span> snipers' posts, listening posts, and nests
from which machine guns had been firing into the American lines. These
ambushes of the enemy were turned over to the tender mercies of the
American batteries, which wiped them out. The positions of the Germans
were made so uncomfortable at various points that they tried to regain
their lost foothold by connecting shell holes. Their guns pounded the
new American positions with heavy shells, some of the twelve-inch
type, without affecting the Franco-American consolidation.</p>

<p>A German battery of mine throwers, one of which had made a direct hit
on a dugout occupied by American soldiers, next received the earnest
attention of American guns in the Lunéville sector. The battery had
been causing considerable trouble. It was finally located, and upon it
high-explosive shells were concentrated. It was blown up.</p>

<p>More German trenches in the Lunéville sector were destroyed. The enemy
vacated them. When a patrol, without assistance from the artillery,
crossed no-man's-land, they found the first and second positions wiped
out. The patrol obtained further information and returned without
casualties, the Germans apparently not daring to molest them. The
indications behind the German lines were that they saw the need of
constructing stronger earthworks to withstand the American fire. A
patrol ascertained that the enemy had constructed trenches built of
concrete half way up the side, and was using rock crushers and
concrete mixers for building a number of "pill-boxes" opposite the
American front.</p>

<p>Meantime the foe gave renewed attention to the Toul sector. One new
form of attack came from a German aeroplane, which dropped rubber
balls filled with liquefied "mustard" gas. The effect of these novel
air missiles was not serious. The gas merely infuriated the troops,
and when the Germans heavily attacked the American positions with
shell fire, gas shells were hurled at the enemy from American
batteries. Four gas attacks ware launched at the Germans, whose guns
were presently silenced.</p>

<p>The Germans later responded by concentrating a heavy gas attack on a
town behind the American lines. No wind was blowing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page354" name="page354"></a>(p. 354)</span> and the
fumes of the "mustard" gas from the shells hung low over the lines for
a long time. The batteries firing the gas shells were located and the
American gunners retaliated with doses of gas twice as large as the
American positions received. In fact, two towns held by the Germans
were so heavily gassed that one of them, Réchicourt, north of Xivray,
one of the American targets, was abandoned.</p>

<p>German snipers in this sector were also a constant worry to the
Americans. As fast as one nest was silenced, another was found, and
the task of wiping out the nuisance had to be repeated. In one
instance, a group of American snipers discovered an enemy nest close
by and promptly opened fire on it. The Germans replied with their
rifles, and then fired about three dozen or so of grenades. Apparently
the Germans had come to stay and did not intend to be chased out. One
of the American 37-millimeter gun teams then got into action against
the nest, and owing to its accurate fire no more Germans were seen at
this particular point. The Germans were frequently presented with
examples of the accuracy of the fire of these 37-millimeter guns. An
enemy machine-gun emplacement which had been annoying the Americans
was located and then the battery of "little fellows," as the guns were
known along the front, got into action, firing rapidly. They secured a
number of direct hits and destroyed the emplacement guns.</p>

<p>These small guns, which are about the size of a one-pounder, were
easily moved from place to place even in the trenches. They also
secured direct hits on the junction of communication trenches as men
were passing, and into the entrance of the dugout which a number of
the enemy were seen to enter and from which smoke was issuing. None of
the enemy was seen to come out.</p>

<p>In April the Germans attempted an ambitious local operation against
the Americans northwest of Toul. They planned to enter the third line
positions, it was subsequently learned, and for this purpose they sent
a special battalion of 800 shock troops equipped with wire, dynamite,
intrenching tools and other implements for adapting trenches to their
own use. The attack was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page355" name="page355"></a>(p. 355)</span> preceded by a violent bombardment of
the American positions, lasting three days. Hundreds of shells fell,
many of them charged with gas. At sunrise on April 10 the German
infantrymen signaled their batteries for a barrage, and under it they
started out for the American line. They were selected from the best
men of three regiments and were preceded by shock platoons. The
American gunners did not wait for any rocket signal from their own
side before getting into action. They immediately started a
counterbarrage, which caught the advancing Germans before they could
reach the American wire entanglements. The German officers sent their
troops through the answering barrage, with the result that fewer than
200 of the 800 troops succeeded in making any advance. Only two
reached the American line; both were captured and one died immediately
after from wounds.</p>

<p>The fighting developed on no-man's-land. American outposts moved to
the first line and with other infantrymen and machine gunners waited
for those of the attackers who survived the American barrage. As the
raiders neared the Americans poured a deadly fire into them, then
climbed out of the trenches and engaged them with grenades and in
hand-to-hand fighting. The enemy was driven back to his own lines,
suffering serious casualties from American heavy machine-gun and rifle
fire rained on his men as they fled. No-man's-land was strewn with
German dead; several bodies hung on the barbed wire after the enemy
retired; and numbers were killed by American guns before they could
leave the German trenches. The fight lasted two hours in a heavy
morning mist; but the American gunners found their aim despite the
poor visibility.</p>

<p>It was a crushing defeat, and two days later the Germans, smarting
under it, sought to avenge it by reorganizing the 800 shock troops,
which were filled out by picked men from other units, and ordering
them to take the American positions. As before a violent bombardment,
accompanied by gas shells, signalized the attack. The German guns kept
up a harassing fire all night, and with dawn came the infantry attack,
directed against French troops who flanked the American forces on the
left in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page356" name="page356"></a>(p. 356)</span> forest of Apremont. While this engagement was
proceeding the Americans launched a counterattack on the German line,
moving forward behind a perfect curtain fire. The enemy, driven out of
his trenches, was forced to fight in the open. A deadly machine-gun
and automatic-rifle fire was poured into the Germans, who offered
stubborn resistance at first, but latter retreated to their second
line, hotly pursued by the American troops.</p>

<p>After an interim the Germans resumed the attack at a point farther to
the right. The American barrage fire cut them off, but the German
officers drove their men through the exploding shells until a few
succeeded in penetrating the American front line. A counterattack by
the Americans ejected the enemy, driving him back to his positions.</p>

<p>The struggle lasted throughout the day, and was the first all-day
battle in which the Americans had been engaged. Their loss was slight.
They lost no prisoners, but gained thirty-four of the enemy. The
prisoners taken belonged to six different organizations. Five were
Uhlans, and all were carrying haversacks well filled, as if in
preparation for a protracted stay in the American trenches,
corroborating the stories told by prisoners previously taken, who said
that the Germans had been ordered to penetrate the American third line
at all costs.</p>

<p>Several deeds of individual heroism marked the engagement. In one case
a young lieutenant, with three men, attacked nineteen Germans who had
penetrated into one of the American trenches. The lieutenant called on
the Germans to surrender. One of them raised his pistol, as if to
shoot, but the lieutenant shot him through the head, upon which the
others lifted their hands high in the air and yelled "Kamerad." The
lieutenant marched the prisoners in to the rear and then returned to
the front and resumed the command of his platoon.</p>

<p>Five other Americans penetrated into a German dugout where twelve of
the enemy were slightly wounded. The Germans resisted surrender, but
our men threw grenades into the dugout, killing four of the foe. The
others quickly gave themselves up.</p>

<p>Despite their failure, the Germans the next day continued their
efforts to drive through to the American third line. An <span class="pagenum"><a id="page357" name="page357"></a>(p. 357)</span>
incessant artillery fire blended with gas shells prefaced two bitter
attacks both of which the Americans withstood. In all, the enemy spent
four days in trying to take the Apremont position.</p>

<p>German activities against American forces were next heard of north of
St. Mihiel, where a new American sector, located on the right bank of
the Meuse, south of Verdun, was disclosed. The enemy's raid had the
usual characteristics. It was made by a force of 400 picked troops
brought from the Russian front, who outnumbered the Americans by more
than two to one. The Germans leaped from their trenches under their
barrage; the Americans did likewise; and there was a hand-to-hand
affray with grenade and bayonet. The upshot was a German casualty
list of sixty-four dead, many wounded, and twelve prisoners, and the
hurling back of the survivors to their own lines.</p>

<p>While these scattered local operations enlivened the various American
sectors, the great German spring offensive was proceeding against the
British and French well out of the established American zones. As that
offensive developed in its scope, less attention was paid to the
American lines east of Verdun, and save for the Seicheprey raid and
the clash at Xivray, both to be presently described, the operations
there were of little moment.</p>

<p>The usual little amenities of war went on between isolated groups of
combatants, mostly local scrimmages in which not more than a dozen or
twenty men participated. These took the customary form of patrol
actions, clashes between scouts, the uprooting of enemy's snipers'
nests and the occasional invasion of trenches by one or the other
side. There were ceaseless artillery duels, accompanied by clouds of
gas, and daily fatalities, not all of them due to actual warfare.</p>

<p>Here and there small engagements, by reason of a swinging,
thoroughgoing effectiveness on the part of the bands of Americans who
shared in them, stand out of the daily routine of the trench warfare.
In one that took place near Bremenil, east of Lunéville, in May, 1918,
when a body of Germans essayed to attack the American positions,
solely to take prisoners to ascertain the American strength, not a
single German got back who succeeded <span class="pagenum"><a id="page358" name="page358"></a>(p. 358)</span> in entering the American
trenches. A gas bombardment led the attack, followed by a heavy
barrage fire, under which fifty German soldiers attempted to reach the
American line; nine of the fourteen raiders were killed outright, four
were captured, and one died of wounds. No American was captured.</p>

<p>While comparative quiet reigned in the St. Mihiel, Toul, and Lunéville
sectors, as the summer advanced, a further extension of American
sectors, eastward of these positions, running almost to the Swiss
border, became revealed in General Pershing's reports. American
forces were heard of at St. Dié, Mulhouse, Colmar, and near Belfort.
With the main German forces busily&mdash;and unsuccessfully&mdash;engaged on
other parts of the front, the Americans hereabout appear to pass
uneventful days. The German forces before them, barring their
occasional liquid fire, artillery outbreaks, air reconnoissances, and
machine-gun activity, were disposed to let well enough alone.</p>

<p>By July, 1918, Americans practically occupied the whole of the
Lorraine-Alsace front. Their positions gradually became disclosed and
may now be stated with some particularity as follows: First, east of
St. Mihiel; second, north of Lunéville; third, east and a little south
of Lunéville or north of Badonviller; fourth, near St. Dié; fifth,
just west of Gebweiler, which is just east of the battle line, and,
sixth, east of Belfort, near Altkirch. Roughly speaking, these
positions were about equally distant from one another and divided the
entire front from St. Mihiel to the Swiss border into sections
averaging about twenty-five miles each, over a front of approximately
150 miles. This became now the distinctly American front, and extended
approximately one-third of the entire western front.</p>

<p>The United States, to all intents and purposes, had created an
"Eastern front" of her own in taking over the southeastern portion of
what was known as the western front. Here General Pershing's legions
could drive directly into Germany by the shortest route with the least
cost in men and material, and with the least delay.</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page359" name="page359"></a>(p. 359)</span> CHAPTER XLV</h2>

<p class="title">AT SEICHEPREY AND XIVRAY</p>

<p>The Germans had reached the conclusion that the Americans must be
taught a lesson. The latter were making a disquieting impression
elsewhere on the western front in cooperating with Anglo-French forces
who were resisting the German advance. Moreover, the Americans in
their own sectors showed an unseemly enterprise and eagerness to meet
the kaiser's hosts at close quarters, and even to hold them in small
esteem. Besides, the people at home must be persuaded that the hordes
of untrained and raw Americans who were spreading along the western
front were negligible and despised factors as belligerents, and the
best way to drive this conclusion home to the German people was to
give the Americans a sound thrashing. Such a disciplinary measure, the
German mind reasoned, would also have the effect of discouraging the
Americans from continuing to come to the rescue of their sorely
pressed Allies.</p>

<p>The American sector running eastward of the famous salient of St.
Mihiel was chosen as the location of the castigation. In this sector
lay the village of Seicheprey among rolling hills, overlooking a
winding valley that runs to the northeast. The German positions were
on high ground, commanding the Allied trenches, and directly opposite
them, behind the American line, Seicheprey nestled on the southwestern
slope of a steep hill some 900 feet high. On the right, the hill was
approachable on a gradual incline, the greater part of which is
covered by a small rectangular grove called the Wood of Remières. Here
the American line joined the French.</p>

<p>The front of the attack made by the Germans ran something under two
miles from Seicheprey to the Remières Wood. Their object appeared to
be threefold, apart from the ultimate aim to discourage the Americans
and convince the German people that the United States was a poor
antagonist. One was to test the American strength and determine
whether the Americans, still <span class="pagenum"><a id="page360" name="page360"></a>(p. 360)</span> unseasoned, as measured by the
hardened condition of the other Allied troops, after their four years
of war, would brave heavy shell fire, followed by strong infantry
attacks. The second was to widen the base of the St. Mihiel salient,
which was too narrow to hold with security. The third was to drive a
wedge between the American and French lines.</p>

<p>The assault came at sunrise on April 20. An all&mdash;night bombardment,
which sent a deluge of shells, many of them of poison gas, into the
American positions, preceded it. A German barrage was launched; the
Americans met it by a counterbarrage. In short, the regulation
artillery curtains were swept across the battle zone, under which the
opposing forces tried conclusions.</p>

<p>On a front extending for a mile and three-quarters the enemy sent a
force of 3,000 men, preceded by picked storm troops, who advanced in
three columns. They had been specially trained for the operation and
greatly outnumbered the resisting Americans; they carried rations and
intrenching tools, indicating that the aim was to occupy the American
trenches&mdash;if taken&mdash;for a long period. On the left and in the center
the assault was repelled, but on the right the assailants succeeded in
occupying Remières Wood, whose eastern edge was a short distance
behind the American line. The Germans pursued their customary tactics
of "infiltration," that is, of gradual progress in small groups,
supported by quick-firers along the line of entry made in the Allied
position with the object of taking the American center in the rear.
Protected by trees and favored by the character of the terrain, the
Germans were so far successful that by night they had reached the
crest of the hill flanked by Remières Wood, and delivered a heavy
attack on Seicheprey.</p>

<p>The Germans carried the village, but only after furious hand-to-hand
fighting. They entered it in the belief that the Americans had gone,
and with good reason, since liquid fire, gas, and other devices of
frightfulness had been used to clear the village. But some Americans
had remained, and they attacked the Germans with hand grenades,
killing many of them. The Americans only fell back when they were
greatly outnumbered, after making a stubborn defense. German airmen
poured machine-gun <span class="pagenum"><a id="page361" name="page361"></a>(p. 361)</span> fire upon them; but the antiaircraft
batteries came into play and American airmen took the air, bringing
down two of the enemy planes and dispersing the others. Before
retiring the Americans fought for every inch of the way, yielding
slowly, and pouring a deadly machine-gun, rifle, and automatic fire
into the advancing enemy.</p>

<p>The Germans were not permitted to hold either Seicheprey or the
Remières Wood. Without a moment's delay the Americans and French
organized a counterattack and drove them out of the village.</p>

<p>It was found that the retreating Germans had set traps there in the
form of boxes containing high explosives to which they had attached
wires stretched across the streets. Some of the advancing troops
stepped on the wire, causing explosions and the traps had to be
removed. Before dawn of the next day the Franco-American forces had
not only recovered the village but forced the enemy back to the
hilltop above it.</p>

<p>The battle circled about the brow and slope of the hill on which
Seicheprey stood and the wood of Remières at its foot. The Germans
returned to the charge with forces estimated at three battalions, led
by storm troops. Two hours' hard fighting followed. Finally, the
Americans, supported, as before by the French from an adjoining
sector, now drove the Germans down the slope into Remières Wood,
already held by the foe, and fought them among the trees all the
morning. Toward noon the Allies swept forward irresistibly and retook
the wood completely. Fighting stubbornly, the Germans were pushed back
beyond the wood's eastern fringe to their own trenches, where they
endeavored to maintain themselves. But a new Franco-American advance,
combined with pressure from the flank, forced them to retreat, and by
evening they had retired to the original starting point, and the
American line was completely reestablished.</p>

<p>It was the first time the Germans had met the Americans in serious
fighting on a scale which removed the engagement from the category of
small skirmishes in local operations, and apart from the ultimate
result, which was a defeat for the Germans, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page362" name="page362"></a>(p. 362)</span> they learned
something of the quality of Americans, both as massed and individual
fighters.</p>

<p>North of Seicheprey an American detachment was separated into small
groups and was cut off from the company to which it belonged
throughout the entire fight. Behind the Americans and on their left
flank were German units, but they could have retired on the right.
They decided to fight, which they did notwithstanding the incessant
enemy bombardment and rifle fire. Numerous hand-to-hand combats were
fought in the course of this long struggle, from which the Americans
found themselves obliged to retire toward nightfall, but only after
destroying their machine guns.</p>

<p>In Seicheprey a squad of Americans found several cases of grenades,
with which they made a determined fight, holding out the entire day on
the northern extremity of the village. They refused to surrender when
summoned to do so, and at the end of the fighting only nine out of the
original twenty-three were left. A cook surprised by the Germans, and
half stunned by a blow from a grenade, seized a rifle and continued
firing until he fell dead.</p>

<p>Toward evening a hospital which had been established in Seicheprey was
blown up, along with the doctors and ambulance men. The chief surgeon
of the American regiment engaged hurried to the spot with French and
American ambulance cars. The rescue party passed through a severe
barrage fire, but eventually reached the village, where they tended to
the wounded for many hours under a heavy enemy fire.</p>

<p>The American losses were never clearly known. They were estimated at
200. The Germans claimed 183 prisoners, which would leave only
seventeen dead and wounded on the American estimate. The scope of the
battle showed that the American losses in dead and wounded were much
more than that, hence the number of prisoners the Germans claimed was
discredited.</p>

<p>As to the German casualties, a German prisoner put them at 600 killed,
wounded and missing, of these, more than 300 German dead were found in
the American trenches and in no-man's-land. The defeat of the Germans
was sufficiently proved by the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page363" name="page363"></a>(p. 363)</span> omission of the German
official bulletins and the German press to mention the successful
counterattack.</p>

<p>The Xivray affair (June 16, 1918) in the Toul sector furnished another
example of American alertness and vigor in an emergency. Xivray was
originally behind the German lines, but they had been penetrated by
the Americans, and the town was in American hands. As was the case in
other engagements, German prisoners betrayed that the enemy's purpose
in raiding the town was to carry off as many Americans as possible
with a view to extracting information from them. The enemy's design,
as thus revealed, was to send a large party without preparatory
artillery fire. They were to take up a position near the American
barbed wire, and send a signal rocket for a box barrage to cover
Xivray and the approaching communication trenches, while heavy
artillery bombarded the villages in the rear.</p>

<p>The American fire apparently precipitated a violent bombardment. It
came at 3 o'clock in the morning and was directed at the American
first line before Xivray, the American batteries, and at villages far
in the rear. An Associated Press correspondent thus described what
follows:</p>

<p>"Six hundred men advanced to the attack in no less than a dozen
different columns, led by 200 picked Bavarian storming troops. They
came up on the right flank, on the left, and on the center under cover
of smoke, making a dark night still darker. They crept up the ravines
and slipped through the hollows. The sharp ears of sentries alone
prevented a total surprise.</p>

<p>"Their guns laid down a heavy box barrage that prevented the
reenforcing of the front line. One platoon, led by Lieutenant Doan,
got through the first curtain of fire. Doan even went through the
second with some volunteers, but that was all the help that could be
sent to the 225 men that were holding the line attacked. They were
only one to three, but they fought in a way to surprise and dismay the
600 Germans.</p>

<p>"One machine-gun section in the village was reduced to two
men&mdash;Monfort Wyckoff and John Flynn. Their gun jammed and Flynn kept
the Germans off with his revolver while Wyckoff <span class="pagenum"><a id="page364" name="page364"></a>(p. 364)</span> got the
quick-firer going again. They held their ground to the end. Two other
men, unable to get a sight at the Germans from their trench, climbed
the parapet and stood there erect, firing their automatics from the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Two companies of infantry, without dugouts to shelter them, held
their ground on the right of the position through a heavy artillery
preparation and kept the enemy from bringing up reenforcements
throughout the fight. Meanwhile, in the center at Xivray and on the
left, the machine gunners did the rest.</p>

<p>"The enemy's plan, according to prisoners, was to force the village,
destroy the defense works, make the place untenable, and take
prisoners. The effort was well organized and might have succeeded but
for the work of the quick-firers.</p>

<p>"The Germans had lost a third of their 600 men when growing daylight
impaired the effectiveness of their smoke screen, and they began to
retire. The fifty-odd unwounded Americans left out of 225 went over
the top after them.</p>

<p>"Two hundred is a conservative estimate of the German losses, for our
men buried forty-seven of them on the field, and there were more
corpses in the tall grass facing the position out of reach. Thus the
Germans lost nearly as many men as they had facing them during the
fight."</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XLVI</h2>

<p class="title">ON THE CHEMIN-DES-DAMES</p>


<p>As early as February, 1918, American batteries were heard on the
French lines east of Rheims, where American gunners were apparently
under training by the French before going into action on their own
front. An opportunity came to them to show their quality when the
French determined to suppress a German salient which dipped into the
French position between Tahure and Butte du Mesnil, in the Champagne.
It was a difficult operation owing to the nature of the ground, which
formed a basinlike <span class="pagenum"><a id="page365" name="page365"></a>(p. 365)</span> depression, into which the Germans could
pour the fire of their concentrated guns from the surrounding heights.</p>

<p>Artillery did the main work. American gunners took part in a six-hour
bombardment of the salient on a front of a mile, and so thoroughly
were the German defenses demolished that it took the French assaulting
troops only an hour to gain all the objectives in view. Afterward the
American gunners, with their French comrades, extended their range,
developing an effective barrage to prevent counterattacks on the newly
won ground. "American batteries gave very effective support," said the
French communiqué in reporting this successful raid.</p>

<p>About the same time American units appeared on the Aisne fighting
front in the vicinity of the famous Chemin-des-Dames. They had been
detailed there for training purposes; but their location was not
revealed by General Pershing until the Germans themselves knew of
their presence. They had been there weeks before their presence became
known. Suddenly ordered from their billets, they entrained to the
railhead, and passed through mile after mile of shell-scarred,
desolate ground and through several great piles of stones and débris
which once were villages but now had not a single house standing. They
took up their positions without a hitch to the music of roaring guns,
both friendly and hostile, their flashes stabbing the blackness of the
night, first here and then there, as far as the eye could see.</p>

<p>Many of them were quartered in quarries twenty feet underground, one
quarry having room for sheltering 3,000 men. Other recesses beneath
the surface occupied by them were partly natural in formation and
improved through blasting operations by the Germans, who occupied them
for three years. But most of the American troops were above ground,
having established themselves in trenches and dugouts which they had
cleaned, strengthened, and improved and protected by barbed-wire
entanglements.</p>

<p>The cave dwellers' chief barracks was seventy-two feet underground.
This cave ran in long galleries with cement ceilings, and was lighted
by electricity, acetylene lamps, and oil lanterns. The troops slept on
low, double-tiered wooden bunks provided <span class="pagenum"><a id="page366" name="page366"></a>(p. 366)</span> with straw. Here the
troops usually remained from four to six days each, a company being
assigned to a certain portion of the cavern. Being new to active field
service, they were not permitted to roam about at will, lest they be
lost, nor to leave the cavern at all except on duty, lest they be
detected by enemy airmen.</p>

<p>The appearance of Americans on this sector was greeted by the Germans
with a sign reading: "Welcome, Yankees." It was promptly riddled with
bullets till it looked like a sieve.</p>

<p>The French and Americans responded to this little pleasantry by an
attack on the German lines at Chevregny on February 23, 1918. The
French organized a little raid on the German lines, aided by
twenty-six picked Americans, and rehearsed the operation the day
before. An hour's barrage at dawn brought the Americans moving
forward eagerly with their French comrades. They moved so fast,
indeed, that they came within thirty yards of the dropping shells on
reaching the enemy lines. It was the first time American troops had
essayed an attack under such a curtain of fire, and their ardor
actually took them beyond their objectives.</p>

<p>In the German trenches officers were making the rounds after morning
relief when the Americans and French burst in. The Germans rushed to
shelter in a dugout roofed with rails and sandbags; but this refuge
was immediately shattered by a French shell.</p>

<p>Deprived of this cover, the Germans scattered about the trench. The
entire party at this point was captured after some hand-to-hand
fighting. Other shelters and communicating trenches were cleared
without yielding any prisoners. A German counterbarrage caught the
raiders and their captives on returning across no-man's-land, wounding
five Germans and six Frenchmen, but no Americans.</p>

<p>American soldiers starting out to storm Cantigny, on
the Picardy front. They were aided by French tanks. The attack, which
took place on May 21, 1918, was entirely successful.</p>
</div>

<p>The Germans directed a strong retaliatory assault against this sector
a few days later. Its repulse revealed that the Americans were in
sufficient force to hold a considerable portion of the front line.
Three companies of trained shock troops were sent to take the American
trenches under a heavy German barrage. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page367" name="page367"></a>(p. 367)</span> American artillery
responded with a like curtain of fire as soon as the German barrage
was raised, and American machine guns sent streams of bullets into the
advancing enemy. The fighting was brisk for about an hour; but the
accurate machine-gun and rifle fire from the American front lines,
coupled with the perfect American barrage, which prevented
reenforcements from coming up, forced the Germans to withdraw after
sustaining heavy casualties and without having set foot in the
American trenches.</p>

<p>After the attack a patrol was found to be missing. A platoon set out
into no-man's-land to find them in a rain of machine-gun bullets. The
German fire was too heavy, and they returned without finding any trace
of the missing men. It was assumed that the latter had been too
venturesome and were captured.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XLVII</h2>

<p class="title">BEFORE AMIENS</p>


<p>The Allies' resistance to Germany's spring offensive of 1918, which
aimed to reach the Channel ports and Paris, at first revealed no
indication that American forces were taking part in the defense. The
sweep of her first advance, begun on March 21, 1918, extended from the
vicinity of Arras, on the north, to La Fère, on the south. The latter
town was near a great bend then in the western line around the wood of
St. Gobain, a short distance northwest of the Chemin-des-Dames, where,
as shown in the previous chapter, Americans were stationed. Hence the
German attack swept within fighting distance of American arms.</p>

<p>The United States was in sufficient strength along the western front
to make it certain that General Pershing would not let Great Britain
and France bear the sole burden of meeting the German advance. But for
some days the share of the American forces in the fighting was veiled
in mystery. Berlin finally shed a little daylight on the subject. In
its official communiqués of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page368" name="page368"></a>(p. 368)</span> March 24 and 25, 1918, it alluded
to American reserves having been thrown back on Chauny, which is eight
miles west of La Fère. These bulletins contained the following
passages:</p>

<p>"The British Third and Fourth Armies and portions of Franco-American
reserves who had been brought up were beaten, and on the line of
Bapaume-Bouchavesnes and behind the Somme, between Péronne and Ham, as
well as at Chauny, were repulsed with the heaviest of losses.</p>

<p>"The corps of Generals von Webern and von Conte and the troops of
General von Geyl, after a fierce battle, crossed the Crozat Canal.</p>

<p>"French, English, and American regiments which had been brought up
from the southwest for a counterattack were thrown back on Chauny in a
southwesterly direction."</p>

<p>The next day General Pershing threw further light on the mystery in a
message to the War Department:</p>

<p>"Reference to the German communiques of the 24th and 25th regarding
American troops: Two regiments of railway engineers are with the
British armies involved in this battle. Three companies of engineers
were working in the areas mentioned in the communique in the vicinity
of the Crozat Canal."</p>

<p>Thereby hung a tale similar to that which recorded the part American
engineers took at Cambrai, as told in the previous volume. By true
Teutonic indirection, the German "Vorwärts," in commenting on the
battle in the area named, indicated that the American share in it was
not negligible:</p>

<p>"Attacks of combined Allied forces against the pivot of the German
attacking front near La Fère were particularly heavy. These
counterattacks did not find us unprepared. It testifies to the
superior foresight of the German command that these attacks, in which
American troops certainly participated only symbolically, were not
only beaten off, but were thrown back on the Oise Canal by an
energetic blow."</p>

<p>These allusions were foretokens that something unusual was taking
place. The staid official language of General Pershing, in a
communication to the War Department, thus described what had happened:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page369" name="page369"></a>(p. 369)</span> "Certain units of United States Engineers, serving with a
British army battalion, March 21 and April 3, 1918, while under shell
fire, carried out destruction of material dumps at Chaulnes, fell back
with British forces to Moreuil, where the commands laid out trench
work, then proceeded to Demuin, and were assigned a sector of the
defensive line, which was constructed and manned by them, thence moved
to a position on the line near Warfusee-Abancourt and extending to
north side of Bois de Toillauw. The commands started for this position
on March 27, 1918, and occupied it until April 3, 1918, during this
time the commanding officer of a unit of United States Engineers
being in command of the subsector occupied by his troops. This command
was in more or less continuous action during its stay in this
position. On April 3, 1918, the command was ordered to fall back to
Abbeville."</p>

<p>General Rawlinson, commanding the British forces engaged in this
battle, acknowledged the services performed by American engineers in a
letter to the colonel commanding a United States engineer regiment.</p>

<p>"I fully realize," he wrote, "that it has been largely due to your
assistance that the enemy is checked.... I consider your work in the
line to be greatly enhanced by the fact that for six weeks previous to
taking your place in the front line your men had been working at such
a high pressure erecting a heavy bridge over the Somme. My best
congratulations and warm thanks to you all."</p>

<p>It appeared that a gap had to be stopped in the bending line through
which the Germans otherwise would have streamed. Amiens lay before
their advancing hosts, and the way was open. The critical moment came
on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 26, 1918. It was imperative that
more troops should be thrown into the British line to arrest the
German onrush. Reenforcements were on the way, but could not arrive in
time.</p>

<p>A dashing British officer, Brigadier General Carey, hastily improvised
a scratch force of every available element within reach. American
engineers were among them, and they were eagerly drawn into the fray.
By telephone, messenger, and flag signals, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page370" name="page370"></a>(p. 370)</span> General Carey
assembled a little army from behind the lines which included labor
battalions, cooks, and orderlies, sturdy middle-aged men, of various
occupations, electricians, signalers, members of an infantry training
school, machine gunners hurriedly armed with rifles, engineers, and
fifty cavalrymen for scouting. He also improvised a staff as he
proceeded, "officers learning the ground," as one onlooker described
it, "by having to defend it and every man from enlisted man to
brigadier jumping at each job as it came along."</p>

<p>Early in the German advance, British reports had mentioned "Americans
fighting shoulder to shoulder with the French and British." No
American force was then identified as in the fight, and not until
several days after did Pershing begin to send reenforcements to the
Allies. The Americans referred to so mysteriously were part of that
strangely mixed force that Carey drummed up from the void. These
engineers at Carey's call picked up rifles and merged themselves in
his motley corps without orders from anybody. They had been called
from their work, which was constructing and operating field railways
and building bridges.</p>

<p>The beginning of their exploits was due to three companies of an
American engineer regiment being caught in the early bombardment.
Ordered to fall back, one of the companies, which had been
consolidated with the British Royal Engineers, was delegated to the
task of guaranteeing the destruction of the engineers' dump referred
to by General Pershing, which it had been decided to abandon. This
detachment destroyed all the material, made a rapid retreat, caught up
with the larger group, and immediately resumed work, laying out
trenches. These operations lasted from March 22 to 27, 1918. As the
German attack became more intense, the engineers joined up with the
mixed force General Carey had assembled.</p>

<p>Then followed a week's brilliant defense of the road to Amiens. Led by
General Carey, this assorted force, numbering 1,500 men, plunged into
the swirling battle line, where they were strung over a front of 1,200
yards, against which hordes of Germans were thrown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page371" name="page371"></a>(p. 371)</span> "It seems almost inconceivable," wrote a correspondent, "that
these defenders, brave unto death though they were, could have been
able to hold that long sector, but they held. The enemy advanced in
force and hurled themselves time and time again against the line in
this region, but they found no weak spot. This composite force stood
as gallantly and as well as their comrades to the right and to the
left. They clung on for many hours until the regulars came up."</p>

<p>What happened at Cambrai had been repeated before Amiens. American
engineers, facing an emergency, had thrown their tools aside and taken
up arms. They were not many; but, nevertheless, history will never
record the battle of Picardy without including the story of how
Carey's men acquitted themselves, nor omit the fact that Americans
were in the fray.</p>

<p>Afterward American troops in strong force took up positions on the
active fighting front in Picardy with the French and British. General
Pershing's first reenforcements occupied a sector east of Amiens on a
rolling terrain. The artillery was first on the line, entering on a
dark night reddened by the continuous flashes of friendly and hostile
guns. Under a fire at times heavy, the American gunners took up the
positions of the French batteries and set about digging in. When the
infantry moved in, the firing was just as intense. In some places the
troops, after passing through villages, were raked with shrapnel. In
several instances they found the trenches shallow; in other cases
there were no trenches at all. The positions were soon improved and
the shell holes connected. The American lines generally ran about 200
to 400 yards apart with the high ground about evenly divided about
them.</p>

<p>The American troops were there to stay. The pack on each man's back as
he entered the firing line was loaded with paraphernalia that pointed
to permanency so far as such a condition obtains in warfare. Each
carried a blanket, with a pair of shoes tied on either side of it.
Among other articles carried were two pairs of socks, a suit of
underwear, a towel, soap, toilet articles, two days' emergency rations
of four packages of hard bread, and a can of corned beef, whatever
trinkets he had, a deck of cards, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page372" name="page372"></a>(p. 372)</span> a set of dice, and
photographs and letters especially cherished by him. In addition he
carried canteen, rifle, bayonet, 160 rounds of ammunition, a shovel,
pick, and a wire cutter (or bolo).</p>

<p>A French communiqué, in reporting a violent bombardment of
French-American positions on April 24, 1918, specifically located the
American sector as "south of the Somme and on the Avre."</p>

<p>The opposing lines ran north and south, with the enemy between the
Americans and the rising sun. Between the rear American echelons
extended the main road between Amiens and Beauvais. Amiens, the German
objective, lay thirty-five kilometers away on the American left.
Beauvais was about the same distance away on the American right and
two hours distant by train from Paris. The Americans were between the
Germans and the sea.</p>

<p>On April 3, 1918, this American line was violently attacked by the
Germans near Villers-Bretonneux&mdash;the first occasion that brought fully
equipped American troops in force into the swing of the continuing
Picardy battle. It was an afternoon bombardment, beginning at 5
o'clock, and lasted for two hours. The German guns were directed
especially against the Americans, who were supported on the north and
south by the French. The intensity of the enemy's fire slacked about 7
o'clock, whereupon the German commander sent forward three battalions
of infantry. The Americans met them and a violent struggle ensued.
There was hand-to-hand fighting all along the line, as a result of
which the enemy was thrust back, his dead and wounded lying on the
ground in all directions. Five prisoners remained in American hands.
The American losses were severe, but so were the enemy's. The French
were full of praise for the manner in which the Americans acquitted
themselves under trying circumstances, especially in view of the fact
that they were fighting at one of the most difficult points on the
battle front.</p>

<p>An interlude of comparative quiet set in, if such a term can be used
when there were daily artillery firing and patrolling. The Americans,
settling in their positions, became stronger; they appeared to be
better intrenched than the Germans, who were continually harassed, day
and night. The enemy was wastefully <span class="pagenum"><a id="page373" name="page373"></a>(p. 373)</span> lavish in the use of gas,
some of it liquefied, in glass bottles which were hurled through the
air apparently by means of a spring. On bursting they liberated heavy,
white fumes that caused nausea, sneezing, and coughing, but did not
otherwise harm the Americans. These missiles, thrown without any
detonation, were a variant on the avalanche of "mustard" gas shells
the Germans periodically showered. They appeared to be disconcerted by
the unmoved bearing of the Americans before the gas assaults; instead
of retreating from the clouds of fumes, the Americans countered by
sending gas of twofold strength into the enemy's lines. In fact, the
Americans always greeted every exhibition of German fire by returning
it two to one. Their positions became daily more firmly established
and those of the Germans more difficult to retain.</p>

<p>Higher up, northwest of these positions in Picardy, American troops
had established positions in union with the British forces under Sir
Douglas Haig. Thus "American fronts" by the middle of May, 1918,
interposed along the entire western line from the North Sea to the
Swiss border. Their distribution between French and British sectors
placed fresh troops where they were needed and afforded scope for
invaluable training in modern warfare to both officers and men that
they could obtain in no other way. Those in Picardy were not long in
proving that they were equal to their experienced Anglo-French
comrades in arms in the task they had set themselves.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XLVIII</h2>

<p class="title">CANTIGNY</p>


<p>Foretokens of a movement against Cantigny came in the middle of May,
1918, when a searching American artillery fire exploded a huge German
ammunition dump at that place and set a number of fires blazing behind
the German lines in Montdidier. Near the latter town the Germans later
drove a wedge <span class="pagenum"><a id="page374" name="page374"></a>(p. 374)</span> into the American line in a retaliatory attack
and stayed there for four hours. The American counterthrust hurled
them back; the troops not only drove them across no-man's-land, but
followed them into their own second line and made a haul of prisoners.
The Germans suffered heavily in the fighting, which was of a
hand-to-hand nature at times. The bravery of the Americans may be
illustrated by the case of a private whose arm was blown off. Dazed,
he kept on fighting, and did not know he had been injured until a
comrade came to his aid.</p>

<p>This attack, like those made on the Lorraine front, was an attempt to
push back new troops with the object of creating a feeling that they
formed a weak link in the defending chain. The next day, however, the
weak link stretched beyond its own line and essayed an assault on
Cantigny. The action, May 28, 1918, took place while huge German
forces elsewhere were in the swing of a drive southward through the
Allied lines between Noyon and Rheims, on a forty-mile front, and had
overrun the Chemin-des-Dames&mdash;throwing back the American forces
there&mdash;and crossed the Aisne.</p>

<p>The Cantigny exploit did not bulk large in the great battle that raged
from Ypres to Rheims; but it showed that, put on their mettle, the new
troops were first-class fighting men and a match for the Germans.
Amiens, in the neighborhood of which the enemy already had had a
foretaste of American valor, was only twenty miles away to the
northwest. To the American right the Germans were forging their way to
the Marne and creating the celebrated salient between Soissons and
Rheims. Away to the left the British and French had just checked the
second phase of the German advance between Ypres and Arras. Cantigny
brought a little consolation to the Allies, though only a
counterdiversion of small account, in the midst of the sweeping German
onslaught.</p>

<p>Just west of the village the Germans held a salient, which the
Americans determined to flatten out. An advance, on a front of a mile
and a quarter, was thereupon organized, involving the employment of a
considerable force, and undertaken under the eye of veteran French
officers, who made safeguarding dispositions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page375" name="page375"></a>(p. 375)</span> of their own
forces to reenforce the Americans if necessary.</p>

<p>The customary artillery fire, augmented by French gunners, signalized
the attack, which began early in the morning. Aided by French tanks,
the Americans advanced through a mist and made the required distance
of 600 yards in ten minutes under machine-gun fire. The tanks found
their path easy, the American guns having already prepared the way. In
fact, their fire smothered the Germans, whose resistance was so
slight that the Americans proceeded to penetrate their positions to a
depth of nearly a mile.</p>

<p>A strong unit of flame throwers and engineers aided the Americans.
Moving barrages preceded the infantry advance, which followed with
clockwork precision. There was some hand-to-hand fighting in the
streets, but the hard-hitting Americans, wielding grenade and bayonet,
managed to clear the enemy out of the village in three quarters of an
hour. A number of Germans had taken refuge in a large tunnel and a
number of caves, which formed part of the village fortifications, and
the Americans had to hurl grenades like baseballs into these shelters
in order to oust them. The Germans entombed in dugouts near by readily
trooped out and surrendered when they saw the futility of resistance.
In short, the garrison at Cantigny was soon accounted for; the men
were either all captured or killed at a slight cost to the Americans.
It was found that the Germans had honeycombed the village with
outposts and machine-gun emplacements.</p>

<p>The Americans had obtained high ground commanding a section of
plateaulike country. In straightening the salient they acquired
territory the length of their two-kilometer advance, as well as
Cantigny, and brought their line well east of the village.</p>

<p>The Germans attempted several counterattacks, persisting in them for
three days. They were met by hurricanes of fire. Waves of German
infantrymen were stopped dead or thrown back, leaving many of their
number killed or wounded on the ground. There were night bombardments,
air bombing, and even tank attacks in addition to fruitless advances
of troops. Foot <span class="pagenum"><a id="page376" name="page376"></a>(p. 376)</span> soldiers and tanks alike recoiled before the
stone-wall resistance offered by the Americans, who did not budge an
inch from the position they occupied on taking Cantigny. On the
contrary, in face of continuous attempts to expel them, they
consolidated their position, and finally came a quiet day, telling
that the Germans had abandoned their efforts to retake the village.
The attack and counterattacks yielded 242 prisoners to the Americans.</p>

<p>Berlin, recording the engagement on May 29, 1918, merely said:</p>

<p>"West of Montdidier the enemy during a local advance penetrated into
Cantigny yesterday."</p>

<p>General Pershing found occasion to comment thus on this announcement
in his report to the War Department:</p>

<p>"Attention is drawn to the fact that the German official communiqué of
May 29, afternoon, in reporting the capture of Cantigny avoids mention
of the fact that the operation was conducted by American troops.
Recent marked endeavors of the Germans to discount the fighting
qualities of our forces indicate that the enemy feared the moral
effect of such admission in Germany."</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XLIX</h2>

<p class="title">AROUND CHÂTEAU-THIERRY</p>


<p>Meantime, some distance to the left of this American sector at
Cantigny, the German thrust between Noyon and Rheims had cut across
the Aisne, took a westward turn and enveloped Soissons, proceeded
south to the Marne between Château-Thierry and Dormans on a six-mile
front, and swung a couple of miles along the Marne beyond Dormans.
Their advance having progressed thus far, the Germans on the Marne and
on the west of the salient they had formed in the Allied line found
themselves facing another American army.</p>

<p>The narrative of American operations in France thus turns from
recording local exploits such as that at Cantigny and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page377" name="page377"></a>(p. 377)</span>
trench adventures that marked the inconsequential warfare along the
American sectors east of St. Mihiel. It becomes merged in the story of
major operations, with the Americans in the thick of a great battle,
fighting shoulder to shoulder with the French on their left, and
joined on their right by more French, aided by British and Italian
troops. American forces in great numbers became a big factor in
arresting the southward sweep of the Germans across the Marne, and in
checking a plunge westward, both operations aiming at a triumphant
march on Paris. Just as the Americans had aided in stopping the
Germans from reaching Amiens, a pivotal point in the British lines, so
did they save Paris. At the tail end of the third phase of his descent
on the French capital via the Marne, the German was slowly beginning
to realize that the despised Americans had become a leading factor in
the war.</p>

<p>There was an imperative call for American aid to reenforce the French
along the Marne and on the western side of the salient. They were
rushed from distant training areas, or from the quiet sectors in
Lorraine and Alsace or from the American positions round Cantigny and
Montdidier and about Amiens on the British front, and once on the
scene they immediately plunged into action to check the German drive.
How one American unit hastened to fill the breach and stem the
Teutonic tide was described by Junius B. Wood as typical of the
expedition with which other detachments moved into the battle zone:</p>

<p>"One evening at 7 o'clock orders came over the long-distance telephone
from headquarters to move. At 10 o'clock the same night camions were
rumbling up, and after all the men had found places, started toward
the fateful Marne. Before daylight they had crossed a goodly part of
France and reached the reserve areas. The camions started back, while
soldiers and officers stretched out along the roadside to snatch a few
hours of sleep. The next night they marched into the support
positions. A few more hours of sleep, and they went directly into the
battle. In less than twelve hours telephone wires were strung and
communication established in their territory. Every part of the
organization from commanding officers to privates were working
perfectly. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page378" name="page378"></a>(p. 378)</span> Supplies were coming up over the roads in the
rear. Ambulances were carrying back the wounded, while the trucks
which had carried up ammunition with which to sow the seeds of death
returned to aid refugees and thus helping to save the living.</p>

<p>"Along the Paris road the dust hung like a fog over the companies
marching forward to take their turn at fighting and other companies
returning for a few hours of sleep. Out of the brown clouds dashed
staff motor cars and ambulances disregarding all speed laws. Trains
of trucks passed the horse-drawn batteries moving into position.
Flashes and ear-splitting crashes came from batteries put in position
just far enough off the roads to avoid the traffic. Men were cooking
beside the guns, and others, oblivious to the suffocating dust, were
sleeping in the midst of the noise and turmoil. All moved according to
a well-ordered system.</p>

<p>"While the guns were barking under the shade trees at the roadside
stolid ox teams with carts loaded with household possessions were
moving to the rear. It seemed as if the guns with their muzzles
pointing the other way were holding back the invaders until those
fleeing fugitives should again reach safety. Other batteries were
hastily unlimbered in fields and orchards where plows and harrows had
been abandoned only a few hours previously by the peaceful peasants."</p>

<p>The Americans entered the line in the midst of a battle which raged
over a hilly country and which shifted back and forth like a
maelstrom. Crops were growing and there were no prepared trenches. The
first unit on the scene was a machine-gun battalion, which rode on
trucks throughout the night of Friday, May 30, 1918, and arrived the
next morning, going into position to guard the bridges across the
Marne at Château-Thierry. Another unit arrived on Sunday morning, June
2, 1918, and before 4 o'clock the same afternoon had been in three
fights, in one of which it drove the Germans back two kilometers on a
front of four kilometers.</p>

<p>The beginning of June, 1918, in fact, which marked the entrance of the
Americans into the battle line of the Soissons-Marne-Rheims <span class="pagenum"><a id="page379" name="page379"></a>(p. 379)</span>
salient, found them in the thick of the conflict almost before they
had breathing time to dig in.</p>

<p>The Germans at once locked horns with them at Neuilly,
Château-Thierry, and Jaulgonne. When the Americans appeared near the
first-named place, the Germans were trying to enter Neuilly Wood. They
had succeeded in entering the village of Neuilly-la-Poterie near by
and found the adjacent woods, occupied by the French and Americans, a
stumblingblock to their advance. The American machine gunners mowed
down the advancing enemy battalions and later supported the French
infantry in a counterattack which forced the enemy to retire beyond
the northern edge of the wood. On June 31, 1918, the Germans made
another attempt to drive the Americans out. They concentrated large
forces and advanced in massed formation. Again they were met by a rain
of machine-gun fire, which smothered a similar hail of bullets the
Germans had shed on the Americans from hastily erected machine-gun
positions on the skirts of the wood. The Americans advanced before the
Germans reached their line, engaged them at close quarters with the
bayonet, broke their formations and sent them fleeing in confusion to
the ruined village beyond the wood whence they had come.</p>

<p>While these attacks were under way American and French troops on the
Marne near Jaulgonne, east of Château-Thierry, were engaged in
repelling a battalion of Germans who had forced a passage of the river
at that point. In a sharp combat, marked by the fierceness of their
machine-gun fire, the French and Americans, fighting side by side,
almost wiped out the German forces which reached the southern bank of
the Marne. Most of the survivors were rounded up in small groups and
captured. They numbered a hundred. A second German attack was launched
later with shock troops, who also gained a footing on the southern
bank, but again their stay was not long. The footbridge on which they
crossed was swept by American machine-gun fire, and rushes of American
infantry forced the enemy back.</p>

<p>The most notable of these preliminary contacts the Germans had with
the Americans on the southern arc of the salient was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page380" name="page380"></a>(p. 380)</span> at
Château-Thierry. The battalion of American machine gunners already
mentioned, which had been posted on May 31, 1918, to guard the river
bridges at that town, found the Germans already in the northern
outskirts. The town lies on both sides of the Marne, which is there
spanned by a big bridge. A little to the northward a canal runs
parallel to the river and is crossed by a smaller bridge. The Germans
had made their way into the northern part of the town through a gap
they had driven in the Allied lines to the left, and began to stream
through the streets toward the bridge, intending to establish
themselves firmly on the southern bank and capture the town.</p>

<p>They reckoned without the American machine gunners, who had been
suddenly thrown into Château-Thierry with French colonial troops. The
Americans immediately took over the defense of the river bank,
especially the approaches to the bridge. They began operations by
poking the muzzles of their weapons through broken walls, bushes, and
holes knocked in the sides of the houses. The guns were skillfully
hidden and the Germans were unable to locate them. The latter wavered
under the American fire, their advance was brought to a standstill,
and a counterattack by the French colonials drove them from the town.
As usual the Germans attempted a counterassault. The next night, June
1, 1918, taking advantage of the darkness, they stole toward the large
bridge, in which direction they penetrated through the western suburbs
to the banks of the Marne. In order to mask their movements, they made
use of smoke bombs, which made the aim of the machine guns very
difficult. At the same time the town underwent an extremely violent
bombardment. A surprise, however, was in store for them. They were
already crossing the bridge, evidently believing themselves masters of
both banks, when a thunderous explosion blew the center of the bridge
and a number of Germans with it into the river. Those who reached the
southern bank were immediately captured. Holding the south end of the
bridge, the Americans covered the withdrawal of troops across the
bridge before its destruction, and although under severe fire
themselves, kept all the approaches to the bank under a rain of
bullets, which nullified all the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page381" name="page381"></a>(p. 381)</span> subsequent efforts of the
enemy to cross the river. Every attempt of the Germans to elude the
vigilance of the Americans resulted in disaster to them. The upshot
was that the Germans abandoned the occupation of the northern part of
Château-Thierry, which American machine guns made untenable, and it
became a part of no-man's-land. The Americans altogether made a
brilliant defense of the town. A French staff officer described it as
one of the finest feats of the war. There was little left of the town
itself. It was shot to pieces and became a pile of bricks and stones.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER L</h2>

<p class="title">A DRIVE BY THE MARINES</p>


<p>American operations in the salient now took a more active turn to the
northwest of Château-Thierry in the vicinity of Neuilly, where the
Germans had already clashed with their new antagonists. There the
Americans were linked with the French on a line that rested on
Neuilly-la-Poterie, and ran through Champillon, Lucy-le-Bocage, and to
the south of Triangle, and then meandered in an irregular course to
Château-Thierry. From this line came a forward movement on June 6,
1918, directed east of Neuilly toward Torcy, Belleau, and Bouresches.
The next day the line stood south of the village of Torcy, south of
the village of Belleau, with the wood of Belleau partly in American
possession, and through Bouresches, then south to the highway east of
Thiolet, and thence to Château-Thierry. This advance represented an
extension of the American line over a front of about six miles to a
depth of nearly two and a half miles.</p>

<p>The brunt of the fighting was borne by United States Marines. It was a
sustained action, extending for thirty-six hours. It held the center
of the war stage; on no other part of the fighting fronts were there
any measurable activities that produced like successes against German
arms. The movement, which aimed to drive the German lines farther back
from their Paris objective also had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page382" name="page382"></a>(p. 382)</span> its significance in that
its second stage was directed by American commanders and undertaken
solely by American troops. Most of the fighting by Americans on the
western front had been carried out under French commanders. The
American units detailed to the Somme, for example, reported to the
French command, who assigned them with French soldiers where they were
most needed. The commander of the unit to which the marines belonged
wanted full control of his own sector in the Château-Thierry region.
The request was granted, and the result showed that an American unit,
acting on its own initiative, could acquit itself equal to the
best-trained German unit.</p>

<p>The first assault on the enemy lines was made at dawn, when the
American marines swept forward, with the French attacking on their
left, and gained over a mile on a four-mile front. By 8 o'clock they
had gained all their first objectives and held all the important high
ground northwest of Château-Thierry. They captured 100 prisoners,
among them thirty-five mounted Uhlans, and ten machine guns.</p>

<p>The enemy had augmented his line recently, the Americans having
pressed him so hard that he was forced to throw three new divisions of
his best troops into the breach. Against them the Americans advanced
in a solid phalanx, singing and whistling "Yankee Doodle," and
cheering. No barrage preceded them, although there had been some
advance artillery preparations. On certain parts of the line the
resistance was weak; but in other instances our marines ran into
German machine-gun nests which, in some cases, succeeded in inflicting
considerable casualties. But they did not stop the Americans. Marines
with hand grenades and rifles charged the machine guns, wiping out the
nests, and in one instance capturing a gun and its crew.</p>

<a id="img026" name="img026"></a>

<p class="smcap">Where the American marines stopped the German advance
on the Marne.</p>
</div>

<p>From the new line gained by the first attack, a second American
advance was made at five in the evening, and by night it reached Torcy
and Bouresches. The next morning, June 7, 1918, the Americans were
holding Torcy in the face of repeated counterattacks and pushing back
the Germans through the streets of Bouresches. Torcy was not part of
the American objective, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page384" name="page384"></a>(p. 384)</span> but the eager marines swept into the
village by their own momentum.</p>

<p>The hardest fighting took place in the wood of Belleau, to the east of
Torcy and between that village and Bouresches.</p>

<p>The wood of Belleau into which the marines penetrated with such ardor
proved a hornets' nest. It was ambushed with machine guns, which
hampered the American advance and caused many casualties. There were
about twenty of them in the plateau formed by the wood. The Americans
vainly tried to demolish them by rifles, mortars, and hand grenades.
Finally, despite the streams of bullets, they surrounded the plateau,
cut off the Germans in it, and went ahead, capturing a hill beyond the
wood and inflicting heavy losses on the Germans as they withdrew.</p>

<p>The tireless and undaunted marines then moved on Bouresches. It was a
night attack, marked by volleys of machine-gun fire which they poured
into the enemy stationed in the village. Bayonets were freely used
whenever the Germans attempted to make a stand in the streets. The
path of the Americans was not easy. They drove the Germans out in the
face of heavy artillery fire, including gas shells, but several times
they were balked by machine guns operated by Germans from house roofs.
At last a lieutenant, with what was left of a platoon, penetrated into
the town under heavy German fire and cleared it of infantry. He held
it for thirty minutes, until two companies of Americans came to his
aid. They spent an hour routing out the German machine gunners with
rifles and hand grenades, when the ammunition began to run low. A
runner was dispatched for supplies and another lieutenant hastened to
the rescue with a truck load of ammunition. On the road to Bouresches
he was the target of a heavy fire from Germans who had hidden behind
the advancing Americans; but he succeeded in getting the truck into
the town and distributing the sorely needed ammunition.</p>

<p>The American position created by the capture of Bouresches ran from
that village to Le Thiolet and guarded the highway from
Château-Thierry to Paris. On June 8, 1918, the Germans vainly attacked
this position. They also tried to retake Bouresches <span class="pagenum"><a id="page385" name="page385"></a>(p. 385)</span> without
success. They could not advance beyond the railroad tracks to the
north of the town, where they had intrenched themselves after being
driven out by the marines.</p>

<p>The Germans started a night bombardment on the position, to which the
Americans did not respond until the enemy's movements revealed that an
attack on Le Thiolet was intended. A heavy American barrage was
thereupon laid down, which cut the communications of the attacking
force and hampered its reenforcements. The Americans were in shallow
trenches, hastily prepared, but well equipped with machine guns, which
poured a concentrated fire on the enemy when he advanced within 600
yards. Under that fire he continued for 200 yards and then stopped.
Undismayed by this repulse, the enemy sent another body of troops to
attack the American positions south of the highway, where, on the edge
of a wood, the Americans had posted many machine guns. The gunners
allowed the Germans to advance a certain distance and then rained
their fire upon them. More than a hundred German dead covered one
small field swept by the American bullets. The enemy was halted and
driven back by a rush of Americans from their trenches in the face of
a hail of bullets showered upon them from behind the German lines.
This rear fire marked both the attack and repulse, but did not deter
the Americans.</p>

<p>It now came the turn of the marines occupying Bouresches to beat off a
German attack aiming at its recapture. The trio of counterassaults
appeared to have been designed so that the third should be the grand
finale, or a culminating surprise for the Americans. The latter were
alert, having been forewarned, and were reenforced by a number of
machine guns. These they placed on the top of the embankment along
which the railroad track ran. The slaughter of the Germans was
ruthless when they ventured to cross the track. None returned who got
past the embankment; they were either killed or captured. The attack
was repeated, but each attempt to retake Bouresches failed.</p>

<p>The Americans with their machine guns paid the Germans back in their
own coin. One of the chief obstacles to the Americans' progress was
the German fire from such guns. Bouresches <span class="pagenum"><a id="page386" name="page386"></a>(p. 386)</span> when taken was
found dotted with positions for them in strong locations and they had
to be demolished by mortars. The Germans appeared to rely more on
their machine guns to arrest the American advance than on any other
weapon of offense. When not fixed in locations they were portable,
being mounted on carriages and pushed along by their operators. The
Germans also used a light field mortar, mounted on a two-wheel truck,
in the same way.</p>

<p>The three days' fighting produced the usual crop of striking
incidents. One marine who was taking back a prisoner ran into two
German officers and ten men. He fought them single-handed with his
rifle and bayonet, killed both the officers and wounded seven of the
men. Another sergeant was about to take a prisoner when the German
threw himself on the ground and discharged his revolver at the
American after calling "comrade," the sergeant shot him, as he did
four others who also had surrendered, but refused to put up their
hands. In Torcy twenty-five Americans engaged and drove out 200
Germans, and then withdrew to the main line on the outskirts of the
town. A corporal in a company of marines, all of whose officers,
including the sergeants, had been killed or wounded, took the command
and led his men to their objective.</p>

<p>The élan of the Americans in the whole adventure was expressed by a
private who was among the first to rush into Torcy:</p>

<p>"I never saw such wonderful spirit. Not one of our fellows hesitated
in the face of the rain of the machine-gun fire, which it seemed
impossible to get through. Every German seemed to have a machine gun.
They fought like wild cats, but the Americans were too much for them."</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page387" name="page387"></a>(p. 387)</span> CHAPTER LI</h2>

<p class="title">BELLEAU WOOD</p>


<p>There was a dangerous bulge in the new American line formed by Belleau
Wood. In their advance the Americans had been unable to take this
forested little stronghold perched on a hill among rocks, and had
swept past it, after capturing a near-by elevation, and rushed on to
Bouresches. The wood concealed ambushes of German infantry and machine
guns, which were a thorn in the side of the Americans on the
outskirts. They had made several raids in the wood, expelling groups
of Germans here and there; but the next day the enemy would reappear
and pour a harassing fire on the American lines. Notwithstanding
searching shelling from American guns, the Germans seemed to retain a
firm hold.</p>

<p>A German attack on June 8, 1918, to oust the Americans from the
positions they held on the borders of the wood precipitated an
energetic counterassault to clear the enemy completely out. The
Americans had already matured plans for riddling the entire woody
plateau with a deluge of shells. This artillery scheme was carried out
on mathematical lines, the area of the wood being marked off into
checkerboard squares, a square to each battery. Every part of the wood
therefore had established targets for the American gunners to play
upon. The artillery preparation lasted all of Sunday and Monday, June
9 and 10, 1918. It was the most expansive exhibition of ordnance in
action that the Americans had undertaken. The wood was raked with more
than 5,000 high explosive and gas shells. At 3 o'clock on Monday
morning the marines, who had been in conflict with the Germans in
their attack of Saturday, proceeded to advance into the wood and
penetrated it for two-thirds of a mile on a 66-yard front.</p>

<p>The operations were tersely reported by General Pershing to the War
Department as follows:</p>

<p>"June 11.&mdash;Northwest of Château-Thierry we were again successful in
advancing our positions in the Belleau Wood. We <span class="pagenum"><a id="page388" name="page388"></a>(p. 388)</span> captured 250
prisoners, of whom three were officers, and considerable material,
including a number of machine guns and trench mortars."</p>

<p>"June 13&mdash;Yesterday afternoon our troops northwest of Château-Thierry
captured the last of the German positions in the Belleau Wood, taking
fifty prisoners and a number of machine guns and trench mortars, in
addition to those taken on the preceding day."</p>

<p>The Germans now became a menace on the borders of the wood, where they
impinged on a number of awkward pockets or little salients. The
Americans in the wood enjoyed no sinecure, but were engaged in
continuous skirmishes against groups of the enemy. One small pocket
the Germans found too untenable under American fire on the northern
side of the wood and hastily vacated it on June 19, 1918, enabling the
Americans to advance five-eighths of a mile without resistance. A
short and sharp artillery fire on the position presaged an infantry
attack, which the Germans elected not to face. They carried their
material with them in their retreat, and the Americans, therefore, did
not take any machine guns nor prisoners. On the morning of June 21,
1918, the Americans straightened their line further on the northern
and eastern side by a series of small but effective attacks. They
rushed the positions held by the enemy without the customary artillery
opening. The Germans for the most part fired a few shots and retired.
Members of one post alone held their ground, only to be annihilated.
To the east a thin line of American skirmishers obtained the objective
in view there by merely firing as they advanced.</p>

<p>Still the borders of the wood were not clear of the Germans. On June
23, 1918, the Americans directed their attention to the northwestern
corner, where the Germans held positions that appeared impregnable.
The Americans, in a night attack, started a heavy barrage, after which
they went forward and drove out the Germans. The operation lasted only
half an hour.</p>

<p>Another engagement that took place in the same quarter on the same day
was more extensive in scope though local in object. It resulted in the
Americans advancing their lines a distance of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page389" name="page389"></a>(p. 389)</span> 200 to 400
yards on a front of one kilometer, routing the Germans out of several
hidden gun nests, and the capture of five machine guns. The fighting
was marked by certain features, described by Edwin L. James:</p>

<p>"This fight, which lasted four hours, was not accompanied by artillery
or gas fire, and was mostly close hand fighting, the kind which
Americans most prefer. It was a fight such as seldom occurs in this
war, where usually trench positions are so well defined that barrages
can be laid safely by both sides down to a matter of inches.</p>

<p>"Germans and Americans got so mixed up in the north end of the Bois
de Belleau that neither side risked using artillery for fear of
killing its own men.</p>

<p>"The Americans began to advance at 6 o'clock in broad daylight. In the
extreme north wood the Germans had been able to establish some machine
guns, which were firing against us. Our men advanced against these
positions and discovered that to the north of the wood the Germans had
established a strong line position."</p>

<p>As to the ubiquitous machine guns, the Americans found that the
Germans had organized such posts with great ingenuity:</p>

<p>"At one point the nature of the terrain prevented machine guns on the
ground from commanding the surrounding area. Here a dead German gunner
was found seated in the crotch of a tree, his hand still resting on a
machine gun slung from a pulley and carefully counterbalanced down so
that it could be pointed in every direction. This German stayed at his
post until an American shot him.</p>

<p>"Another machine gun was found on a cleverly concealed platform in a
tree, while in another tree a one-pounder was mounted until we put it
out of commission.</p>

<p>"Preceding the advance of our infantry, American artillery had put
down a heavy bombardment of German positions in the woods, but large
trees impaired the effectiveness of the shells."</p>

<p>The retention by the Germans of positions abutting on the wood had
been reduced to a single point on the north. This remaining menace was
subjected to a dashing attack by the Americans <span class="pagenum"><a id="page390" name="page390"></a>(p. 390)</span> on the night
of June 25, 1918. In their various forays they had cleared the enemy
out of the wood several days ago; but the discovery was made that
under cover of darkness the Germans had planted machine guns behind
huge bowlders, in sunken roadways, in shell holes, and in trees in a
narrow area on the edge of the wood. It was most difficult to reach
them in these positions, and some fierce hand-to-hand fighting
occurred in the clearing process.</p>

<p>The attack involved an artillery bombardment lasting thirteen hours.
Only a small strip of underbrush, behind which the Germans had raised
their defensive works, remained to be cleared; but the importance of
the American advance was not to be measured by the extent of territory
taken. Though it only amounted to some 500 yards, it gave them
possession of virtually all of Belleau Wood, and enabled them to
dominate the ridge beyond, held by the Germans, besides straightening
their lines for more effective resistance to counterattacks as well as
for offensive operations. Over twenty machine guns were captured, with
a number of automatic rifles, small arms and ammunition, and 311
prisoners.</p>

<p>It was a surprise attack, in which the American artillery played a
brilliant part, throwing the whole German line in confusion and making
it such an inferno that prisoners said they were glad to get out of it
alive. In advancing, the Americans went one way and the German
officers tried to force their men forward the other way. One prisoner
was shot in the leg by his own officer because he hesitated confusedly
between the American guns and bayonets and the pistols in the hands of
the German officers.</p>

<p>An American private, who was in the first line of the advance, gave
this glimpse of the operation:</p>

<p>"We took up a position in the open wood; there were no trenches. The
Germans opened a heavy fire and shells fell around us like rain. We
charged over the rocky hill, our fellows laughing and yelling a war
whoop. We then came upon a wheat field and crossed in the face of a
withering shell and machine-gun fire, and drove back the Germans at
the point of the bayonet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page391" name="page391"></a>(p. 391)</span> Interposing between the attacks around Belleau Wood were
skirmishes for the possession of Bouresches. This town, being only a
mile or so to the south of the wood, constituted a menace to the
Americans if retaken by the Germans, and consequently the latter made
several determined efforts to regain it. Two hours after the Americans
made their first attack on Belleau Wood on June 10, 1918, the Germans
launched heavy forces against the Americans holding Bouresches. A dark
and cloudy night aided their preparations for the rush, but the
Americans, expecting an assault, had the northern side of the town
lined with machine guns, and had artillery trained on the railroad
embankment over which the Germans had to come. When, at 5 o'clock, the
Germans came they met a terrific machine-gun fire, while a heavy
barrage behind the attacking party, and gradually lowered on it, not
only cut off reenforcements, but killed many in it.</p>

<p>Two fresh divisions were thrown against the American center. Trusting
to the deep woods northeast of the village and the twisted spur of a
hill to conceal them, the leading divisions advanced in mass
formation. They, however, were observed from the Bois de Belleau and
were brought under a destructive hail of shrapnel before they could
deploy. The fire was so severe that the attack was disorganized and no
progress could be made for some time.</p>

<p>When the Germans did succeed in penetrating the defenses, they were
met with such enthusiasm in cold steel that their only choice was
death or surrender.</p>

<p>Another violent attack on the town came on the morning of June 13,
1918. The Germans succeeded in entering the town after raking the
American positions by a furious bombardment. The Americans promptly
darted out of their shelters and engaged the invaders in a
hand-to-hand conflict, in which the latter were all killed or
captured.</p>

<p>A moonlight sortie across the Marne east of Château-Thierry provided a
diversion for the American forces at that point while the marines were
busy on the Belleau-Bouresches line. Once over the river, they
established contact with hostile forces, killed a considerable number,
and brought back prisoners, mainly from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page392" name="page392"></a>(p. 392)</span> Landwehr units. The
following description of the raid was furnished by an Associated Press
correspondent:</p>

<p>"Heavy clouds obscured the moon and a light drizzle had just begun to
fall when the two parties of Americans embarked in small boats and
rowed across the river from two points of the wooded bank. They
crossed without detection. One party entered the woodside held by the
Germans and penetrated cautiously under the dripping trees for a few
hundred feet.</p>

<p>"A break in the clouds suddenly let the moonlight through, and the
Americans saw Germans near by. The Americans immediately opened fire
from a little rise in the ground, and the Germans threw themselves
flat. Rifles cracked, and then the automatics got into action. Those
of the enemy who remained alive were taken prisoners. Twelve enemy
dead were counted before the patrol made its way back to the boats and
rowed to its own side of the river.</p>

<p>"The other patrol met another enemy party, apparently sentries, going
on guard. Several of the Germans were killed or wounded and one was
taken prisoner."</p>

<p>A previous diversion at midnight was directed at a wood, also to the
east of Château-Thierry. Aerial photographs had revealed a host of
enemy troops and much material concealed there, and upon them the
American guns poured an avalanche of projectiles, sending 1,200 shells
of all calibers into one small area in ten minutes. To the west of the
town, a fight occurred round a commanding hill whose northern, or
unimportant side, was held by the Germans. The latter sent forces
around both sides and over the top to expel the American and French
troops, who held the crest and the other flanks of the hill, without
gaining an advantage.</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page393" name="page393"></a>(p. 393)</span> CHAPTER LII</h2>

<p class="title">THEIR PRESENCE FELT</p>


<p>The exploits of American forces during the month of June, 1918, in
the Château-Thierry region of the Soissons-Rheims salient had a
significance of their own, which was not lost on their admiring
Allies, nor on their German foes. A new combatant, stripped and eager
for action, had plunged into tasks which would have taxed the hardened
and more experienced troops of France and Great Britain. Though
confined to a small area, the American achievements were sufficiently
notable to prove that the Americans had speedily become the equals of
any other warriors on the fighting fronts. In the numerous fights
centering on Belleau Wood their captures of Germans reached 1,000. A
number of them belonged to the crack Fifth German Guard Division,
which includes the Queen Elizabeth Regiment. There had been 1,200
Germans in the wood. With the exception of the prisoners nearly all
the rest were slain. The guard division named was regarded as one of
the kaiser's best body of fighters; but the Americans were surprised
to find their morale very low and that they were no match for American
vigor and audacity.</p>

<p>At the beginning of June, 1918, American troops stepped into a
seven-mile sector northwest of Château-Thierry and stopped the
Germans, at the very tip of their salient, from getting any nearer to
Paris. More than that, on a front of ten kilometers they hurled almost
constant blows, which advanced their line from two to four kilometers,
all the way inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, and taking some
1,500 prisoners. Of eleven distinct engagements the Americans won ten.
They kept eleven picked German divisions occupied, which might
otherwise have been used with telling effect elsewhere. There was no
doubt at all that the quality of the American fighters had proved a
source of considerable concern to the German High Command. An
oft-repeated canard current in France was to the effect that the
Germans <span class="pagenum"><a id="page394" name="page394"></a>(p. 394)</span> did not wish to punish the Americans by sending their
best troops against them, preferring not to arouse the American
spirit. Nevertheless, the kaiser had sent his most famous battalions
to try conclusions with the Americans, and they had been beaten.
Learning of the Americans' presence on the Marne, two crack German
divisions, the Fifth Guard and the Twenty-eighth, which had been
ordered elsewhere, were suddenly swung south to face the Americans.
Their arrival caused some wonderment among the French and American
officers. The Americans were a feared foe. A captured German officer
said these two divisions were on their way to the rear for a four
weeks' rest, to take part in another offensive, when suddenly they
were ordered to the front northwest of Château-Thierry, "in order to
prevent at all costs the Americans from being able to achieve
success."</p>

<p>The examination of other prisoners, from the Twenty-eighth German
Division, elicited information which formed the subject of a French
army report.</p>

<p>"American assistance," this report observed, "which was underestimated
in Germany, because they doubted its value and its opportunity,
worries the German High Command more than it will admit. The officers
themselves recognize that among other causes it is the principal
reason for which Germany hastens to try to end the war and impose
peace.</p>

<p>"In addition, the prisoners did not conceal their great surprise at
the training and quickness that the Americans have shown against them,
nor for the good work accomplished by the artillery, which for three
days engaged them, cutting off all food supplies and all
reenforcements and causing them very heavy losses&mdash;practically all of
the officers and twenty-five of the men were killed or wounded in a
single infantry company and twelve in a machine-gun section, of which
the full quota was seventeen men."</p>

<p>Testimony of a similar tenor was found in a letter taken from the dead
body of a German killed in Belleau Wood. It was written to his home
people and dated June 21, 1918.</p>

<p>"We are now in the battle front," it said, "and canteens dare not come
to us on account of the enemy, for the Americans are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page395" name="page395"></a>(p. 395)</span>
bombarding villages fifteen kilometers behind the present front with
long-range guns, and you will know that canteen outfits and others who
are lying in reserve do not venture very far, for it is not pleasant
to 'eat cherries' with Americans. The reason for that is that they
have not yet had much experience. American divisions are still too
fiery.</p>

<p>"We will also show the Americans how good we are, for day before
yesterday we bombarded them heavily with our gas. This had caused
them already great losses, for they are not yet sufficiently
experienced with gas bombardment. About 400 of us are lying around
here.</p>

<p>"We have one corner of the wood and the Americans have the other
corner. That is not nice, for all of a sudden he rushes forward and
one does not know it beforehand. Therefore one must shoot at every
little noise, for one cannot trust them."</p>

<p>In the fighting round Château-Thierry a number of drafted men were
thrown into action to replace other units of the established army
forces. The latter were men of the regular army, the marine corps, and
the old national guard. All these had previous training under arms;
and many had been in actual combat in the Philippines, Haiti,
Nicaragua, at Vera Cruz, or on the trek into Mexico after Villa. But
the drafted men had had no such hardening prior to going into
cantonments, where the training, although severe and thorough, was not
acquired under conditions of actual warfare with an enemy at hand. The
drafted men of the new national army nevertheless went under fire
before the kaiser's picked hosts, not as raw recruits, but capable
soldiers of mettle and valor. They were more undisciplined, owing to
the easy nature of American life, than the young men of other nations;
yet they readily accustomed themselves to discipline. They were
unfamiliar with war, because of their country's immunity from its
terrors; yet they were equal to the emergency when it came.</p>

<p>The exploits of the marine corps in their swing from the original
American position to the Torcy-Bouresches-Château-Thierry line stand
out in strong relief. The massed efficiency of the rest of the
American forces was not the less conspicuous because <span class="pagenum"><a id="page396" name="page396"></a>(p. 396)</span> of the
marines' achievements. That the latter acquired a certain prominence
was perhaps due to the fact that their daring and resourcefulness was
never without an element of the picturesque. They were stationed at
the point nearest to Paris to protect it; but they did not wait to be
attacked. They chose to take their offensive, which continued on their
own initiative, advancing beyond the object in view, and gained ground
against determined opposition. Their bravery was tempered by judgment,
and their steady progress and small losses showed that it was not
marred by recklessness.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LIII</h2>

<p class="title">VAUX AND HAMEL</p>


<p>July, 1918, was a red-letter month in the annals of American
belligerency on the European battle field. Events of historic moment,
in which American soldiers, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the
French, were irresistible protagonists, crowded one upon another. They
had got into their stride; they were seasoned and in the pink of
condition; no German heroics could withstand them.</p>

<p>As a sort of prelude to their memorable participation in General
Foch's offensive stroke of July 18, 1918, the American troops
undertook a little offensive of their own to the west of
Château-Thierry, and accomplished their object with devastating
results to the enemy.</p>

<p>The investment and capture of Belleau Wood to the northwest had
completed a chain of operations designed to secure the American
positions. But there remained an awkward loop or sag which it was
deemed desirable to remove. Its straightening involved the occupation
of a little village called Vaux, with its tap on the main railroad
line into Château-Thierry, the capture of a knoblike crest of ground
designated as Hill 192, on the edge of Clerembauts Wood, and also the
routing of Germans from a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page397" name="page397"></a>(p. 397)</span> sizable cluster of trees, midway
between the two other points and known as the Bois de la Roche. The
front of the attack was about two and a half miles, stretching from
the village of Triangle, then north to the Bois Clerembauts, across
the Paris road, and running south of Vaux. Vaux was an important
objective, being considered vital to the Germans for holding
Château-Thierry.</p>

<p>The Americans went over Vaux and established themselves just beyond
the northern edge of the village, taking in the same rush the hills
just to the west of Vaux. This eliminated the German wedge almost
completely, the only remaining portion being at the wood of
Clerembauts, where the Germans were in a pocket.</p>

<p>A merciless, methodical artillery fire was leveled at the German
positions on the morning of July 1, 1918. American guns, big and
little, hurled torrents of high explosive and gas shells on the
village with a deadly accuracy of aim. By noon Vaux was on fire. Every
house had been hit at least once. A shell would fall on some little
habitation, a cloud of yellow smoke would arise, and the house was no
more. The American guns continued to belch all day with an
unemotional, matter-of-fact regularity from the depths of a score of
leafy woods.</p>

<p>In the evening the infantry advanced. They swept through the enemy
lines and, had their object been to continue the advance, they could
have done so with the greatest ease, as virtually everything before
them had been cleared.</p>

<p>"The advance started at 6 o'clock, and at 6.25 the first of our men
entered the village of Vaux. By 6.40 they had gone through the wood,
gaining all their objectives. Our stormy petrels took Vaux in clean-up
style. Squads were ready with their hand grenades to clear the
cellars, but many of these had been closed by our fire, and the
Germans had been buried in them. From others the Germans came out and
surrendered. In some there was difficulty, and in that case our men
threw in hand grenades in great numbers. Generally, if there were any
Germans left, they surrendered.</p>

<p>"Four hours after the men went over the top American telephone lines
were working from Vaux back to our headquarters. By 7.30 our
ambulances were running into the wrecked village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page398" name="page398"></a>(p. 398)</span> "A wounded German brought in about 10 o'clock said that in
the morning there had been 4,000 Germans in the village, but after the
barrage started some had been withdrawn, leaving only those who could
be sheltered in sixty-eight caves in the village. He said the cave in
which he took refuge was wrecked by an American shell and that he lay
wounded for six hours until the Americans came in."</p>

<p>For adroitness, dispatch, thoroughness, and sustained teamwork, the
attack on Vaux was an undoubted triumph for American arms, though a
small one. Each man moved to the particular post in the town to which
he had been assigned to perform his allotted task. None failed, and
the operation was completed with systematic smoothness; as though in a
twinkling, it was all over.</p>

<p>With Vaux and the Bois de la Roche in their hands, the Americans took
their machine guns to the edge of the wood, expecting a counterattack.
It duly came, the Germans launching a fresh regiment upon the lost
positions; but an hour later all was calm&mdash;the regiment was no more. A
second counterattack broke in the small hours of July 3, 1918,
accompanied by a heavy bombardment. The enemy lost heavily without
regaining a foot of the ground won by the Americans. The Germans
advanced in close formation from their trenches without being checked.
In some cases they were allowed to approach close to the American
line. Then the American gunners, from their hidden nests, mowed down
the enemy ranks with showers of bullets.</p>

<p>Later came a fight for the possession of a hill known as 204, situated
between Vaux and the Bois de la Roche. The Germans held it and the
French, in essaying the task of wresting it from them, invited
American detachments to lend a hand. The hill stood just outside the
American sector and commanded Château-Thierry. Volunteers were many;
most of them were new arrivals who had never faced the Germans.
Practically none had been under fire. They were waiting their chance,
some swimming in the Marne, others catching baseball, when the call
came, and the response was five times the number needed.</p>

</div>

<p>A group of thirty Americans joined the French; they were pitted
against hidden machine guns, camouflaged rapid-fire nests, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page399" name="page399"></a>(p. 399)</span>
gas shells, and the deafening roar of a heavy barrage. They were shot
at by snipers hiding in trees, they were shot at by big and little
cannon with a roar that deafened them; but they went ahead with the
French veterans. They took machine-gun posts, they took trench
positions. But the German resistance was too strong, due in part to
their new device of fighting in ambush from the tops of high trees,
where they escaped shells exploding on the ground, and obtained a good
vantage point for pouring shot downward on the attackers below.</p>

<p>Elsewhere on the western front American forces, linked with the
British lines, aided a body of Australians to attack Hamel. It was an
early morning advance, extending one and a half miles on a four-mile
front, including the village of Hamel and the trench system beyond it,
south of the Somme.</p>

<p>It was the first time Americans had fought with the British. They
comprised only a few companies fighting as platoons among the
Australians; but upon them rested the honor of the United States in
the adventure. The date, moreover, was July 4, 1918.</p>

<p>"You are going in with the Australians," their officers told them,
"and these lads always deliver the goods. We expect you to do the
same. We shall be very disappointed if you do not fulfill the hopes
and belief we have in you."</p>

<p>The Americans listened with a light in their eyes. They went in, with
"Lusitania!" as their battle cry, celebrating the Fourth of July with
"astonishing ardor, discipline and strength," the Australian officers
said. If the Americans had any fault at all, the Australians
commented, it was overeagerness to advance; they could hardly be
restrained from going too rapidly behind the wide belt of the British
shell fire as the barrage rolled forward.</p>

<p>The Hamel episode projected as a reminder that American forces were
clinching with the foe on other parts of the front as well as on the
Marne. But it was on the latter battle ground that the eyes of the
world were presently drawn. There the American army swung into its
greatest stride at this stage of the war.</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page400" name="page400"></a>(p. 400)</span> CHAPTER LIV</h2>

<p class="title">ACROSS THE MARNE AND BACK</p>


<p>Officially Germany had refused to recognize the growing weight of
American belligerency. If she could evade alluding to American forces
specifically in reporting events on the battle field, she did so. "The
enemy," to be sure, covered a multitude of enemies&mdash;more than half the
world&mdash;so why designate which one, and why designate the one now most
feared, of whose mounting strength it was not expedient to enlighten
the beguiled people at home?</p>

<p>The pretense could no longer be sustained after her abortive drive
against the eastern and southern flanks of the Soissons-Rheims salient
on July 14, 1918. There was a reason. Germany might ignore the
presence of American detachments operating with the French or British
and be airily blind to the activities of American patrols along the
Lorraine or Alsace fronts. They were merely "the enemy." But in making
this plunge to widen the salient by way of encircling Rheims and
cutting another way to Paris she crashed into an obstacle that
compelled recognition. It was the First American Army Corps, numbering
some 250,000 men, under the command of Major General Hunter Liggett.
If Americans, in her self-deceiving view, had before been as needles
in a haystack, here they had become the haystack itself, and it was
all needles!</p>

<p>The American army skirted the southern arc of the salient, eastward
along the Marne somewhere beyond Jaulgonne, westward through
Château-Thierry to Torcy, where it joined the French. Germany's first
operation was to make a feint of attacking the American lines
northwest of Château-Thierry by way of screening her major operation,
which was to break through the American barrier guarding the Marne.
The assault was especially violent in the Vaux area, which was
enveloped in a heavy barrage following the usual bombardment of high
explosives and gas. Under the barrage storming parties attacked the
village. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page401" name="page401"></a>(p. 401)</span> The system of infiltration by groups was followed
and some of the groups succeeded in penetrating one of the American
outposts on the northeast. The Americans swarmed out and poured a
withering rifle and machine-gun fire on the assailants, and
counterattacked on the latter's right, where the penetration had taken
place. It was a direct and flanking fire, held in reserve until the
foe had approached the American front-line trenches, from which the
troops had withdrawn. Its effect was to demoralize the attackers, who
retired in disorder.</p>

<p>The counterattack brought the American lines 750 yards ahead and
yielded a number of prisoners, whose capture was due to a barrage laid
by the American artillery, which cut off the enemy's retreat.</p>

<p>The attack had an immediate sequel in the evacuation by the Germans of
Hill 204, upon an advance by the Americans up its west side. The
Germans had paid much to hold this hill, resisting many assaults,
notably the one described in the last chapter, and now they chose to
vacate it rather than defend the hill further. Their tenure of all
this area was to be very brief, and perhaps they knew it.</p>

<p>Soon after the Vaux demonstration, the Germans attacked the American
and French positions all along the Marne. Ordered to break through the
Americans holding the line south of the Marne, and reach a line
running eleven kilometers south of Jaulgonne, running through
Montigny, they crossed the Marne under the protection of a severe
bombardment, and pushed ahead three kilometers to a line through
Crezancy.</p>

<p>The grand advance was signalized by a long-distance bombardment of
towns in the rear of the American lines. Heavy shells from German
naval guns fell in regions far behind the actual battle area, some
reaching points twenty to thirty miles distant. It was mainly a night
display, marked by a constant hurtling of projectiles from ten-and
fifteen-inch naval guns, and canopied the whole countryside with a
blaze of light. The German purpose was to batter towns and
communication lines beyond the defense line and to harass the movement
of supplies and reenforcements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page402" name="page402"></a>(p. 402)</span> The Marne curls to a salient northward at Jaulgonne, and the
peak of this bend provided the first crossing for the Germans.
Descending upon this point in great force, they succeeded in crossing
the river in the face of a destructive fire from American machine
gunners and infantry, who fought and died where they stood. The
salient could not be held, being exposed to fire from three sides.
Westward of it toward Château-Thierry, and eastward toward and beyond
Dormans, the German advance likewise could not be stayed, and there
was a general withdrawal of American forces along the river bank.</p>

<p>The Germans succeeded in crossing at ten points between
Château-Thierry and Dormans. They threw many pontoon bridges over to
bear their troops. Shoals of canvas boats were also brought into
requisition. These proved more serviceable than the bridges, the
laying of which was repeatedly thwarted by American fire. Protected by
the heavy bombardment, the boats managed to carry the members of the
kaiser's famed Tenth Guard Division, twenty to each boat; but very few
of them got back.</p>

<p>American guns foiled their passage three times. Machine gunners clung
to their posts on the river bank here and there till the last moment.
They poured deadly streams of bullets into the enemy, and only
withdrew when their guns were so hot that they could not be fired. One
group happened to be in a place where the Germans were anxious to
erect a bridge, but their efforts were fruitless. The American bullets
piled up the German dead on the opposite side of the river every time
the enemy started to cross.</p>

<p>South of Jaulgonne the enemy crossed the Marne on six pontoon bridges,
hurriedly thrown over the stream, and masses of infantry swarmed
forward. The artillery constantly had the bridges under the heaviest
fire, and at least two direct hits were made, two of the bridges being
blown up. The task of preventing German swarm, despite these checks,
proved too great, and the Americans fell back to the base of the
salient made by the river.</p>

<p>Once on the southern bank of the Marne, the German masses, augmented
by numbers of machine gunners, proceeded to force <span class="pagenum"><a id="page403" name="page403"></a>(p. 403)</span> the
Americans farther back toward Condé. They had succeeded in landing a
force estimated at 15,000 men in the river sector abandoned by the
Americans. This force promptly started to fight its way south, having
a point about nine miles distant as its objective. The Americans and
French held up this advance to such an extent that two hours after
the time set by the enemy for reaching his objective, he was still far
away from it. The Germans specially suffered heavy losses in the woods
forming the triangle from Fossoy to Mézy and Crezancy. There the
Americans were overwhelmed by such large numbers that the line could
not hold; but nevertheless they refused to retreat where they could
possibly hold a place in the woods. This sent the German advance
sweeping over large numbers of nests which sheltered ten, five, or two
Americans, and sometimes one, who held on while the Germans passed by
and then opened fire on them.</p>

<p>It was manifest that the advance could not be allowed to continue. The
enemy by noon had driven forward over two miles on a front of about
three and a half miles south of the Marne through the American
positions; but he got no farther. Even while fighting in the open
continued, the Americans organized a counterattack in the region of
Condé, below Fossoy, about the time the German advance had apparently
eliminated the salient. There, because of their heavy losses, they
seemed content to stand, and there they remained for four hours.
Meantime American reenforcements came up. Light artillery was hurried
into position. It concentrated a heavy fire at short range, and when
this fire ceased, the augmented American infantry dashed from cover.
Machine gunners moved forward, and, lying on the ground, poured a
stream of bullets into the enemy. The fierceness of the fire brought
the Germans up short. They would not face the steel, and, retiring,
hesitatingly at first, finally broke and fell back.</p>

<p>Points that had fallen to the Germans&mdash;Fossoy, La Chapelle, St. Agnan,
Bois de Condé, Crezancy, and Mézy&mdash;were recovered with French aid. By
4 o'clock in the afternoon the Germans had been driven to the railroad
track skirting the south bank of the Marne. There they took up
positions; but there was no <span class="pagenum"><a id="page404" name="page404"></a>(p. 404)</span> pause for them. The American
gunners got the range of the landing places, where the Germans had
stretched cables by which they hauled boats across the swollen stream,
and there was no retreat in the way they had come. The Americans
pursued them behind the railroad embankment. Slowly the graycoats
were forced back. Some of them swam the Marne to safety, but their
number was few. Many of them were drowned in the river. The Americans
in front were on open ground, making the best use of whatever shelter
offered. German forces were on the hills on the opposite side of the
river, showering high explosives and gas shells upon them, but the
Americans went forward, nevertheless, with gas masks adjusted, and
crawling at times for a considerable distance on all fours. In this
way they advanced bit by bit, and when they came within range close
enough they drove the enemy back.</p>

<p>The Germans retained some precarious positions south of the Marne; but
they were completely swept back across the river between
Château-Thierry and Jaulgonne. They were driven where they were before
the advance began. They vented their wrath the next morning by sending
thousands of high explosive and noxious gas shells into the American
lines. They had set out to swing their line northeast of
Château-Thierry; but it still swung northwest, and presently it was to
swing much farther back.</p>

<p>The American losses were serious, as was to be expected in the most
important action in which the Americans had yet engaged. In return,
however, they exacted a toll from the Germans that made their losses
seem light. It was estimated that they killed, wounded, or captured
20,000 of the enemy. Hundreds of the latter were slain while
retreating across the Marne. One battalion of the 6th German
Grenadiers, according to prisoners, was annihilated in the woods, and
of the other battalion only one company survived. The south bank of
the Marne was lined with German dead, while in the woods south of
Mézy, through which the Germans advanced and retreated, 5,000 enemy
dead lay, some bodies three and four deep where they had dared, in
close formation, the American machine guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page405" name="page405"></a>(p. 405)</span> There were sporadic counterattacks, which were readily
repulsed by the Americans and French. The lines wavered back and
forth, and then came a sudden shift of the pivot of the entire German
action in the Soissons-Rheims salient. The Marne was no longer an
object to be gained, but rather a danger to flee from.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LV</h2>

<p class="title">FORWARD WITH FOCH</p>


<p>American forces mingled with French troops on all sides of the German
salient when General Foch struck its western side. In proportion to
the combined number of French, British and Italian troops, they were
not many. For that reason their achievements stood out with greater
distinction; inferiority of numbers made their exploits conspicuous.
They were with the French south of Soissons, on the southwest corner
of the salient, west of Château-Thierry, along the Marne east of that
town, and east of Rheims, the latter outside the salient proper. They
were thus in the full swing of the Foch counteroffensive which finally
was to crumble the salient to extinction and bring them along its top
at the Vesle River.</p>

<p>No clearly defined picture can be drawn of their share in this
advance. Their operations blended too intimately with the French
movements. Here and there the situation in certain areas disclosed
Americans to be acting on their own initiative. But in the main it was
a Franco-American operation. The movements of each were
interdependent. The advance of both progressed with the uniformity of
a curved chain dragged from each end along a highway. There were dents
and wrigglings in the chain at times; but it moved on.</p>

<p>The advance lent a significance to the earlier operations of the
Americans northwest of Château-Thierry, when they straightened their
line by extending it to the outskirts of Torcy, capturing Belleau
Wood, Bouresches and Vaux. From this line, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page406" name="page406"></a>(p. 406)</span> along a front of
forty kilometers to Soissons, the attack was made at 4.45 on the
morning of July 18, 1918. The perspective is too long for its
development to be described with clearness. Only glimpses can be
obtained of the American participation at points where there were
eyewitnesses.</p>

<p>What was clear was that in their initial effort the Americans carried
all before them. By the late afternoon they had proceeded so fast that
cavalry was thrown into action. By night American headquarters&mdash;a
movable fixture that day&mdash;were well inside territory held by the
Germans in the morning. The line, in short, before the day was over,
had advanced at varying depths, the most being ten kilometers, or a
little over six miles, and the day's captures by the Americans
embraced a number of towns, over 4,000 prisoners, fifty cannon,
thousands of machine guns, vast quantities of munitions and stores,
and airplanes.</p>

<p>Foch's counterattack apparently did not at first contemplate an
assault on the southern arc of the salient formed by the Marne. But
his success in breaking into the western flank evidently encouraged
him to extend his operations to the south. Here American energies came
into full play. Early in the day on July 19, 1918, the Germans had
premonitions of what was to happen, and hastily prepared to withdraw
from the positions they had retained on the south bank. The previous
day they had been clinging in small numbers to the crook of the river
near Jaulgonne, but southeast of that place, on to Oeuilly, thousands
held positions won in their advance across the river, as already
described. Hereabout, along the Dormans line, they were eight
kilometers south of the Marne. Between Château-Thierry and Jaulgonne
they had failed to hold the southern bank and had to retreat. So from
these points the ground was in the hands of the Americans and French
for offensive purposes, and they set about attacking the German
positions early on July 19, 1918, on the west, south, and also east of
Dormans. They signalized the attack with short but intense artillery
work, putting down a barrage along the river bank, to prevent the
Germans from retreating without paying a heavy price for having
ventured so far south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page407" name="page407"></a>(p. 407)</span> "The advance proceeded well from the start," wrote one
onlooker. "By 4 o'clock the Germans were as far east as six kilometers
west of Dormans. South of Dormans the enemy, with his retreat cut off,
made a determined but vain stand.</p>

<p>"By 6 o'clock detachments of Americans and French reached the river
bank in one place, and soon after a message was flashed to all the
armies that the Germans had been put back across the Marne.</p>

<p>"The German artillery gave the men very poor support, and the chief
fighting on their part was done with machine guns. The reason of the
lack of German artillery work is explained in a report of American
aviators that the Germans were busy all yesterday afternoon drawing
back their guns from the heights north of the river.</p>

<p>"While we were pushing north from Château-Thierry to Dormans the
French, with the Americans on their left, attacked the region of
Oeuilly, gaining that place and pushing the enemy back on Chatillon,
north of the river."</p>

<p>A further clearance was made by the Americans northwest of
Château-Thierry. One of their lines ran round Hill 204, which the
Germans had just evacuated, after holding it for five weeks. In
Franco-American hands the hill swung the line more to the east in the
track of the general advance. The movement in this direction caused
the withdrawal of German forces holding the northern part of
Château-Thierry. On July 21, 1918, the whole city was occupied by the
French and Americans. Strong positions were established on the north
of the river, bridges were thrown across, guns were brought up, and
heavy firing was directed over the river to prevent German bombers
from interfering with Franco-American troops crossing over. Jaulgonne
was presently occupied by American troops.</p>

<p>When the Americans crossed the Marne they discovered that the Germans
sought to deceive the Allied air bombers, who were seeking out bridges
and boats along the river and otherwise preventing the Germans from
crossing the stream.</p>

<p>The Americans found submerged boats and floats, held down by rocks,
but so arranged that they could be made accessible <span class="pagenum"><a id="page408" name="page408"></a>(p. 408)</span> for use
by the Germans in short order for crossing. In some instances these
floats spanned the river and were held by cables, and it required only
a short time to float them.</p>

<p>The Germans did not get a chance to use their impromptu bridges, but
the French and Americans made use of the floats when they came in
pursuit of the enemy.</p>

<p>There was now a general advance from the north of the Marne, hitherto
securely held by the Germans. Some fifteen kilometers north of
Château-Thierry, behind a series of hills forming an almost continuous
ridge, the Germans had established artillery positions, and on the
hill itself their infantry waited, prepared for a stand, with machine
guns. The French and Americans advanced, their backs at last to the
Marne, despite the artillery fire from the hill to cover the slow
retreat of the Germans. The latter continued their backward movement
with sullen and stubborn rear-guard actions, leaving numbers of
machine-gun nests in the path of the Franco-American movement. At
times the Americans encountered the stiffest resistance, which took
the form of counterattacks rather than defensive retreats. A village
in this sector being reduced by the American guns, as its occupation
by the Germans was imminent, the enemy was thus forced into the open,
where heavy punishment was inflicted. The fighting was so fierce as
almost to rob it of the suggestion that it was a rear-guard action.
Nevertheless, during the intense struggle the work of moving stores
was under way. With a minimum artillery fire on both sides the
Americans advanced their skirmish line over yellow wheat fields,
dotted with poppies, and through clumps of wood. It was Indian
fighting, modernized by machine-gun work. Fighting in open order in
this way brought the American line by July 22, 1918, to more than ten
kilometers north of Château-Thierry, and beyond Bezu-St. Germain.</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page409" name="page409"></a>(p. 409)</span> CHAPTER LVI</h2>

<p class="title">FIGHTING THROUGH FORESTS</p>


<p>Now came a bitter struggle for the possession of Epieds and Trugny,
to the east and southeast of Bezu-St. Germain. Below Trugny lay
Barbillon Wood, also an objective of the attackers. The Germans
viciously defended these points. A give-and-take battle raged round
the two towns all day on July 23, 1918; but in the region of Barbillon
Wood the Germans fell back, burning depots and ammunition and supply
dumps, and evacuating many farms which had been strongly fortified for
defense. The fighting extended still farther east in front of
Jaulgonne and Charteves. The American progress here was made in the
face of most obstinate resistance by the Germans, who fought every
foot. Even when making steps backward, they endeavored to render the
American progress costly by leaving behind German machine gunners
cleverly concealed in nests. These gunners were not told that the main
body was withdrawing, and were left at the mercy of the advance.
Several of them when captured expressed unfeigned surprise when told
that their comrades had withdrawn.</p>

<p>Châtelet Forest was another stumblingblock. Several sallies into these
woods having proved abortive, the French swung round to the north, and
the Americans to the south. Machine guns and American light artillery
played on the woods, and the Germans were finally uprooted from their
main ambushes there. It was one of the positions the Germans had
chosen for the stand after their withdrawal from the Marne.</p>

<p>The terrain was mostly woody in the area above the Marne where the
Franco-American line had reached. The fighting was therefore pursued
in the midst of concealed antagonists. In the forest of Barbillon the
Germans had a machine gun screened every ten yards of their front.
Their hidden artillery impeded American reenforcements. The attackers
had to beat their way into the woods, encountering rocky ledges that
formed excellent <span class="pagenum"><a id="page410" name="page410"></a>(p. 410)</span> nests for enemy machine guns. The German
positions were excellent for defensive fighting; but with the slow but
sure closing in of their western flank, and a like movement proceeding
east of them, the woods would become traps if they retained them. They
did not retain them. They merely fought spitefully to impede the
Franco-American progress and safeguard the retreat of their main
forces out of the dangerous Marne pocket.</p>

<p>They desperately clung to the region of Epieds and Trugny. At this
point German infantry, which had been pushed back, were thrust forward
again to check the Franco-American advance from the southwest toward
Fère-en-Tardenois.</p>

<p>"The Germans," reported Reuter's correspondent with the American
troops, "fought well and checked the advance for some thirty-six
hours, and three times wrested the village of Epieds from their
determined American opponents. In the meantime the village grew
constantly smaller under the ceaseless bombardment from both sides and
finally disappeared, not even a large pile of bricks being left
behind.</p>

<p>"When the village disappeared the Germans were in possession. The
Americans, tired of the ceaseless ebb and flow of the fighting there,
had taken the slopes on either flank and forced the Germans to make
their final massed attack into the ruins of the village.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the Allied guns had been brought up beyond the crest of the
hill, and as soon as the Germans took possession of the village they
concentrated a terrific fire upon it until the place smoked with its
own red dust as though on fire. When the guns ceased firing there were
no Germans left to capture, or even to bury.</p>

<p>"At the edge of the wood beyond Trugny the German machine guns,
stationed ten yards apart, held up the advance a little longer. Making
a feint frontal attack, however, the Americans crept, Indian fashion,
around the flanks and captured all the guns.</p>

<p>"Afterward the pace of the advance quickened. All the high ground
north of Epieds was taken and the line carried beyond Courpoil."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page411" name="page411"></a>(p. 411)</span> A series of like local actions brought the Franco-American
line by July 25, 1918, well beyond the foregoing points and into the
region of the Fère and Riz forests, where the Germans had retreated
from Epieds. They were dense woods of poplar and oak rising amid thick
underbrush. Hidden among the clustered foliage, German machine gunners
desperately contended for every inch of ground before surrendering
it. They vainly tried to hold the French and Americans in the southern
part of the Riz forest with the object of saving huge supplies
gathered there. An examination of the woods afterward showed hundreds
of tons of ammunition for big German guns, piled six feet high in rows
a hundred yards long for some distances. This ammunition had been
stored there to be used in the advance on Paris.</p>

<p>By a flanking movement above the forest of Fère the Americans carried
the village of Beuvardes, making their line run from that point
through the northern part of Fère forest to Le Charmel and through the
Riz forest southeast to above Dormans. Le Charmel, which lies on the
Jaulgonne road, with a wooded hill on each side, changed hands twice
before taken by the Americans. The Germans had strong machine gun
positions both in the village and on the hills. Their fire raked the
Americans when they charged the village and compelled them to retire.
Later, assisted by comrades from the two forests, the Americans
overcame the Germans, who withdrew from Le Charmel slowly and
stubbornly.</p>

<p>By July 27, 1918, the Franco-American forces had driven the Germans
almost entirely out of the wooded area they had been so obstinately
defending. The pressure was constantly maintained toward the road
junction of Fère-en-Tardenois, the Franco-American objective, and
thither the pursuers progressed through the remainder of the dense
woods and over rain-soaked fields and hills on their outskirts.</p>

<p>In the course of this forest fighting the troops were warned to watch
for Germans wearing American or French uniforms, a device they had
successfully practiced. Rushing across an open place in the forest
when German nests had been discovered, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page412" name="page412"></a>(p. 412)</span> a German, speaking
perfect English, called to American machine gunners:</p>

<p>"Don't shoot. There are Americans in that thicket."</p>

<p>The Americans were at the edge of the forest, firing into a wood
opposite. They ceased when the detachment appeared. The detachment
entered a forest to the right of the Americans, and in a few minutes a
hail of machine-gun bullets came from that direction. The Americans
realized that they had been duped, and turned their machine guns upon
the impostors.</p>

<p>On July 28, 1918, the Americans were on the south bank of the Ourcq.
This river, intended by the Germans to be a halting line, but which
they could not hold, marked a notable point in the American progress
from the banks of the Marne. Foch's forward movement from the west and
southwest had been proceeding simultaneously and now became merged
along this river into the movement up from the south.</p>

<p>American participation from the west had been less conspicuous; but
American troops left their mark, whatever their zone of operations,
and in this area they made their presence painfully felt south of
Soissons. At the beginning of the western advance, east of Vierzy and
northeast of Chaudon, they encountered the pick of the German shock
troops after fighting for thirty hours. The result was that the
youthful Americans, meeting the kaiser's best, who were fresh and in
the pink of condition, themselves essayed the task of becoming shock
troops. They had reached their objectives, a varying number of miles
eastward, and were consolidating their positions when the shock came.
Against one American unit two German shock divisions were hurled;
against another came the famous Prussian Guards. The Germans had
machine guns mounted on wheels and rolled them to the edge of the
woods where the fighting occurred. These guns shot explosive bullets
at the Americans. Shock troops came to close grips with shock
troops&mdash;and the Franco-American advance was not only sustained but
extended.</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page413" name="page413"></a>(p. 413)</span> CHAPTER LVII</h2>

<p class="title">SERGY AND SERINGES</p>

<p>The next striking feature of American participation in the squeezing
of the Germans out of the Soissons-Marne-Rheims salient was the
crossing of the Ourcq and the taking of Sergy and Seringes just beyond
that river. The Germans had meant to make a stand on the north bank of
the Ourcq and hold the Americans on the south bank while their main
withdrawal was effected to the Vesle; but the charge of the Americans
over the river balked this plan. The fighting thus shifted to the
north side, where the Germans, reenforced by two divisions of Bavarian
Guards, settled down to resist the Americans to the utmost. Although
heavily assailed, the Americans replied in kind, especially in and out
of Sergy, three miles southeast of Fère-en-Tardenois. The Germans bent
all their strength toward forcing a recrossing of the Ourcq. The
Americans held their ground, and it was the Germans who finally had to
yield, but only after vicious and bitter fighting.</p>

<p>The Americans began their attack on Sergy early on the morning of
Saturday, July 27, 1918. By night they had been driven back some
distance, but on Sunday morning, when they resumed their advance under
cover of their artillery&mdash;a few pieces going forward with their
advanced line&mdash;they proceeded almost unchecked to the river, crossed
the river and entered the town. The Germans used gas; but the
Americans had long ago had their baptism of gas fumes and knew how to
utilize their masks and avoid the ravines through which the gas
filtered. When the town was occupied there was some street fighting,
which the Germans abandoned by retiring to higher ground beyond. On
Monday morning, July 29, 1918, came a counterattack by the Fourth
Prussian Guard Division, which had arrived only a few hours before
from their training ground in Lorraine. A conflict then ensued which
ebbed and flowed constantly, the town changing hands nine times before
it was won.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page414" name="page414"></a>(p. 414)</span> The Americans immediately advanced two miles, again defeating
the Prussian Guards and Bavarians, though the latter succeeded in
winning Cierges, southeast of Sergy, and holding it for a spell. By
the night of July 30, 1918, the Americans were well to the north of
Sergy, on long slopes approaching heavy woods beyond Nesle, a town
directly east of Seringes-et-Nesle, for which the Germans fought
bitterly.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to the attack on Seringes, a strongly fortified
position, Meury Farm, had to be taken, as from the farm the Seringes
defenses could be outflanked and approached by a less steep ascent
than by a direct attack. In this group of farm buildings the Germans
had, on their withdrawal, left behind a strong force of machine
gunners and infantry, which set up a strong defense.</p>

<p>"The Americans," ran one account, "moved forward through the yellow
wheat fields, which were sprayed and torn by bullets. But they
advanced as though on a drill ground.</p>

<p>"The American guns laid down a heavy artillery fire, but
notwithstanding this many Germans remained when it came to
hand-to-hand fighting. The Germans stuck to their guns, and the
Americans rushed them and killed the gunners at their post.</p>

<p>"It was a little battle, without mercy, and typical of similar
engagements along the whole line. The Prussian Guards and Bavarians
everywhere fought in accordance with their training, discipline, and
traditions, but were outwitted and outfought.</p>

<p>"To the north of the farm, up the long slopes leading to the woods,
the Americans encountered the fiercest exhibition of Germany's war
science. The Germans laid down a barrage which, it was said, was as
heavy as had ever been employed. The American guns replied as heavily.</p>

<p>"On through the barrage the Americans went into the German positions,
attacking fiercely the machine-gun and infantry detachments. The
barrage died away, the Germans leaving the work of resistance to the
men they had failed to protect with their heavy guns.</p>

<p>"The Germans were decimated and the Americans held their new line,
just east of the forest. Not many prisoners were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page415" name="page415"></a>(p. 415)</span> taken, but
here and there a few were rounded up and brought in. One sergeant
contributed fourteen. He attacked eighteen Germans who had become
separated from their command, killing four of them and capturing the
others. Heavy execution was done by the Americans. Eight captured
Guards said that they were all that remained of a company of
eighty-six."</p>

<p>The way was now open for the assault on Seringes, which the enemy
held in great strength. The village was also protected by machine-gun
nests on either side. "The attack," wrote Reuter's correspondent, "was
an almost incredible affair for the coolness with which it was carried
out and for the mere fact that it could be done under such
conditions." The village changed hands five times. After its first
capture by the Americans on Monday, July 29, 1918, the Germans forbore
returning with the usual infantry counterattack, but kept up a
constant artillery and machine-gun fire. This attempt to drive the
Americans out continued all the next day. Toward evening the Germans,
evidently thinking that the spirit of the defenders was weakening
under such withering fire, emerged from the Nesle forest to retake the
village.</p>

<p>"The Americans," said Reuter's correspondent, "after three days of
to-and-fro fighting through villages, had learned subtlety and were
determined to have a real fight to a finish. They consequently
pretended to withdraw as though retiring from Seringes. Some of them
did withdraw, but others remained in the houses and other points of
vantage, and the Germans crept down from the high ground convinced
they had their opponents beaten. Additional German troops came pouring
in until the town was occupied as it never had been before.</p>

<p>"But as the new occupants began to organize their defenses they found
that bullets appeared to be coming in from three sides of the village,
and it was not long before they discovered that the Americans, while
withdrawing from the front of the town, had commenced an encircling
movement on both sides, thus forming a ring almost completely around
it.</p>

<p>"The Americans used machine guns, rifles, and pistols, and employed
both the bayonet and the rifle butt with great effectiveness. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page416" name="page416"></a>(p. 416)</span>
The fighting in the streets was savage, but of comparatively brief
duration.</p>

<p>"The Prussian Guard had voted not to surrender, and their opponents
were just as anxious to see the thing through. It became an affair of
small arms, but the Americans proved to be better shots, and slowly
picked off men here and there.</p>

<p>"Then the Americans began to advance, and slowly their encircling ring
closed about the village. As the ring drew closer and the defenders
saw their doom approaching, they redoubled their fire; but still the
Americans came on unfalteringly, like a storm, or the unavoidable
stroke of fate.</p>

<p>"When the Americans reached the precincts of the village their fire
ceased, and with one wild yell they closed with the foe. The fierce
uproar suddenly gave place to a strange silence as man grappled with
man. Only the clash of steel on steel and the groans of the stricken
could be heard.</p>

<p>"The issue was never in doubt for an instant. At this kind of fighting
the American is more than equal to any Prussian Guardsman, and in a
little more than ten minutes all was over. Except for a few German
prisoners, every German in the village had breathed his last. Such was
the final capture of Seringes."</p>

<p>The Americans awaited the coming of other Germans, but they came not.
So the French and Americans moved on beyond the village, straightening
out the line from that point to Cierges by bringing their heavy
artillery to bear on mile after mile of barbed wire which the Germans
had placed through the hills, forests, and other open places.</p>

<p>The Americans reached Fismes, on the Vesle River, on August 2, 1918,
the Germans retreating before them. They had advanced about forty
kilometers in fifteen days, fourteen kilometers having been gained in
the last two days of their pursuit. On July 18, 1918, they were
intrenched only about Château-Thierry to Belleau; now they were in the
heart of the German salient, which, thanks largely to American aid,
was a salient no more.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LVIII</h2>

<p class="title">THE PEACE WITHOUT TREATY</p>

<p>Throughout the first ten days of February, 1918, the world waited
impatiently and anxiously for a final conclusion to the peace
conference between the representatives of Russia and the Central
Powers, at Brest-Litovsk. Trotzky was still the central figure.
Meanwhile the Bolsheviki leaders were straining every effort to spread
their propaganda throughout the civilian populations of the Central
Powers, as well as among the soldiers on the eastern front. Rumors of
strikes in Germany inclined even those who had previously been
skeptical to believe that the Bolsheviki method might yet gain a great
victory for the cause of the democratic nations.</p>

<p>Ukrainia, as already noted, had declared itself an independent nation,
with a republican form of government, professedly socialistic in
tendency, with Vinitchenko as President. As a matter of fact, however,
the Rada, or Ukrainian legislative assembly, was almost completely in
the hands of the landowners who, naturally, were bitterly opposed to
Bolshevikism and its program of land nationalization. Against them had
risen the Bolsheviki elements of Ukrainia, supported by the Petrograd
Bolsheviki. The conflict between the two factions had created a state
of civil war. The landowners' Rada had sent delegates to the peace
conference, and at first the Petrograd delegation, under the
chairmanship of Trotzky, had raised no objection against the Teutons
recognizing them as the proper representatives of Ukrainia. But during
the last days of January, 1918, came reports of the military <span class="pagenum"><a id="page418" name="page418"></a>(p. 418)</span>
success of the Ukrainian Bolsheviki, even that they had captured
Odessa and Kiev, and then Trotzky contended that the Ukrainians at
Brest-Litovsk no longer truly represented their constituency. The
Germans, however, had forestalled him by quickly recognizing Ukrainian
independence under the Rada.</p>

<p>The German policy was obvious. By recognizing the conservative Rada,
they created a split among the Russian delegates as a whole.
Furthermore, they realized that the Ukrainian landowners feared the
Bolsheviki domestic program far more than they feared German
domination, and in whatever treaty they entered into would offer large
concessions in return for German military aid against Bolsheviki
domination. Thus the Central Powers suddenly found an ally in the
Ukrainian Republic. It also gave them a moral pretext for their
attitude toward the provinces under dispute: Courland and Lithuania,
and parts of Livonia and Esthonia and what had formerly been Russian
Poland, whose populations, the Germans contended, had already declared
themselves for German suzerainty.</p>

<p>The session of the Brest-Litovsk peace conference which was held on
February 9, 1918, was the one at which both sides concluded their
arguments and worked up to the climax of the following day. That same
day the Teutonic delegates had signed a treaty of peace with the
Ukrainian delegates.</p>

<p>"We have officially informed you," said Trotzky, "that the Ukrainian
Rada was deposed, yet the negotiations with a non-existent government
have been continued. We proposed to the Austro-Hungarian delegation
that a special committee should be sent to Kiev, in order to verify
our contention that the Kiev Rada no longer exists and that further
negotiations with its delegation would have no value. We were told
that this would be done and that the delegates of the Central Powers
would not sign a peace treaty until the return of the investigating
commission. Now we are told that the signing of the peace treaty could
no longer be postponed.... Such conduct arouses doubts of the
sincerity of the Central Powers.... The conduct of the other side, so
far as this question is concerned, gives us the impression that they
are endeavoring to make the situation impossible for us. We <span class="pagenum"><a id="page419" name="page419"></a>(p. 419)</span>
cannot consider any treaty binding to the Russian Federal Republic
which is not signed by our delegation."</p>

<p>The main point of difference, however, remained the same as before:
the refusal of the Central Powers to withdraw from what had been
Russian territory, in order to allow the populations to decide for
themselves what their governments should be. This was the ultimatum of
the Germans, as worded by Von Kühlmann: "Russia must agree to the
following territorial changes which will enter into force after the
ratification of the peace treaty. The regions between the frontiers of
Germany and Austria-Hungary and the indicated line will not be in the
future a dependency of Russia. As a result of their former adhesion to
the Russian Empire no obligations will bind them to Russia. The future
destiny of these regions will be settled in agreement with the peoples
concerned, namely, on the basis of those agreements which have been
concluded between them and Germany and Austria-Hungary."</p>

<p>In the afternoon the conference was adjourned that the delegates might
consult among themselves. The last and climaxial session was held on
the following day, the 10th, when Trotzky, after a hot denunciation of
German imperialism, declared that Russia would never agree to the
German terms and would refuse to sign any treaty on such a basis. At
the same time he declared that Russia would not fight any longer and
would withdraw from the war. This decision was approved at Petrograd
and an order for the demobilization of the Russian armies had been
sent out.</p>

<p>This unprecedented conclusion rather nonplused the German delegates
and deeply displeased them. Kühlmann was of the opinion, however, that
Russia could not end her participation in the war in this fashion;
that peace could only be brought about by a special treaty, in the
absence of which the state of war would automatically be resumed at
the termination of the armistice, which had only been arranged for the
purpose of arranging a peace by understanding. The fact that one of
the parties concerned was demobilizing its forces would not change the
situation. The Russian version of the session, as given out officially
from Petrograd, was as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page420" name="page420"></a>(p. 420)</span> "Yesterday, at the session of the All-Russian Central
Executive Committee of the Councils, the president of the peace
delegation, Trotzky, reported on the course and results of the
negotiations at Brest-Litovsk. Not only the representatives of those
political parties constituting the Government majority, but the
representatives of the opposition groups as well, recognized the fact
that the decision taken by the Council of the People's Commissaries
was the only correct one and the course which could be taken with
dignity. The speakers of the majority and the opposition put forward
the question as to whether there was the possibility of a resumption
of German hostilities against Russia. Nearly all were of the opinion
that such an offensive was extremely unlikely, but all uttered warning
against too optimistic an attitude in this regard, because the war
party elements in Germany might force the German Government to such a
course. In the opinion of all the speakers it would be the duty of all
Russian citizens, in such a case, to defend the interests of the
revolution. All were of the opinion, however, that the masses of
Germany and Austria-Hungary would not allow a resumption of
hostilities against the Russian socialists, because such a course
would be too obviously a raid for plunder. The People's Commissary for
Foreign Affairs concluded this report with the statement that Russia
is withdrawing from the war not only in appearance, but in reality. It
is canceling all agreements with its former allies, and reserves
perfect freedom of action for itself in the future. At the conclusion
of the session a resolution was passed approving the action of the
delegation to the Brest-Litovsk Conference."</p>

<p>The first general news of peace with Russia caused public rejoicing in
Germany and Austria-Hungary, but when the details became known the
German and Austrian papers showed the bitter disappointment which
prevailed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Ukrainians were further playing into the hands of the
Central Powers, spurred on by the domestic situation. Said the
"Cologne Gazette," for February 17, 1918:</p>

<p>"Our bread peace with the Ukraine is threatened. Fighting between the
Bolsheviki and the Rada already has brought the Rada government into
such peril that it has been transferred <span class="pagenum"><a id="page421" name="page421"></a>(p. 421)</span> from Kiev to
Zhitomir, and the suburbs of Kiev are already in the hands of the
Bolsheviki.... The Bolsheviki are rushing troops to reenforce the
anti-Rada forces.... Further fighting is to be expected, of serious
significance to us."</p>

<p>The true significance of the pact between the Ukrainian landlords and
the Germans became still more obvious on February 17, 1918, when an
appeal "to the German people" was published. In this document the
bourgeois character of the Rada Government was indignantly denied and
socialistic principles were proclaimed. The Bolsheviki were bitterly
denounced and accused of possessing nothing more than a desire for
conquest and pillage. Having thus prepared the German mind for its
reception, the appeal is delivered in the final paragraph, in the
following words:</p>

<p>"In this hard struggle for existence we look around for help. We are
firmly convinced that the peaceful and order-loving German people will
not remain indifferent when it learns of our distress. The German
Army, standing on the flank of our northern enemy, has the power to
help us and, by its intervention, to protect the northern frontiers
against further invasion by the enemy. This is what we have to say in
this dark hour, and we feel confident that our voice will be heard."</p>

<p>Such was the moral pretext of the Central Powers for a further
invasion of Russia. In return for the protection of their private
property, the landowners constituting the Rada Government were willing
to accept German domination and to send all surplus foodstuffs across
the frontier.</p>

<p>Germany gave ample warning of her intention to continue active
hostilities at the expiration of the armistice at noon on February 18,
1918. It was officially announced that this decision had been taken at
a conference of all the German war chiefs and political leaders,
attended also by the emperor. Austria-Hungary, however, took a very
much more moderate stand and showed strong disinclination to renew the
war. The Vienna papers were practically unanimous in their opinion
that Austria had no further business in Russia, since there was no
longer a common frontier, and with Ukrainia there was a definite peace
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page422" name="page422"></a>(p. 422)</span> treaty. On February 18, 1918, it was officially announced
from Vienna that "an agreement has been reached between Germany and
Austria-Hungary whereby, in the event of military action being
necessary, the German troops will be confined to the frontier of Great
Russia, and the Austrians to the Ukraine only."</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LIX</h2>

<p class="title">THE GERMANS RENEW HOSTILITIES WITH RUSSIA</p>


<p>At 2 o'clock in the afternoon of the 18th, just two hours after the
armistice had expired, German troops began pouring across the Dvina
Bridge. The disorganized Russians fled before them, allowing the
Germans to occupy Dvinsk unopposed. Up and down the whole eastern
front the German lines began a simultaneous movement eastward, the
immediate object being the occupation of the territory coveted by
Germany, the moral pretext being that Germany desired to rescue the
oppressed population from the anarchy of Bolsheviki rule. Farther
south an advance was also made into Ukrainia, but there it was on the
invitation of the Ukrainians themselves, according to the Germans.</p>

<p>The news of the German advance acted on the Petrograd authorities like
an electric shock, awakening them from their delusions. There was
something of panic in the haste with which the Council of People's
Commissaries, the body corresponding to the Cabinet of other
governments, assembled for conference the moment the news reached the
capital. Throughout the whole night they remained in session, in hot
argument over the question of capitulation or resistance.</p>

<p>On this vital issue the two leading figures of the Bolsheviki
Government split; Lenine was in favor of unconditional surrender to
the German demands, while Trotzky declared himself for continued
resistance. Had he remained of this mind he might have changed the
course of events, but before the question <span class="pagenum"><a id="page423" name="page423"></a>(p. 423)</span> was put to vote, he
swung over to Lenine, and the Council decided in favor of surrender,
but only by one vote.</p>

<p>Early next morning the Council issued a proclamation, to the effect
that "under the present circumstances the Council of the People's
Commissaries regards itself as forced formally to declare its
willingness to sign a peace upon the conditions which had been
dictated by the delegations of the Quadruple Alliance at
Brest-Litovsk." Later in the day Ensign Krylenko, the commander in
chief, issued a general order to his armed forces in which they were
enjoined to attempt to parley with all forces of armed Germans they
might encounter and persuade them to desist from advancing farther
into Russian territory, but in case these attempts failed, then a
determined resistance should be made.</p>

<p>The decision of Petrograd to capitulate had been communicated to
German headquarters by wireless. Late in the afternoon the German
commander, General Hoffmann, replied to the effect that the message
had been received, but since a wireless message could not bear
signatures, without which no communication could be regarded as
official, he requested the Petrograd authorities to forward the same
message in written form, properly signed, to German headquarters at
Dvinsk. A courier was immediately sent with an authentic copy of the
Russian capitulation to Dvinsk.</p>

<p>The Germans, however, were in no hurry to respond. The German soldiers
continued their eastward advance day by day, practically unopposed,
gathering in some 10,000 prisoners and vast quantities of arms, heavy
guns, ammunition and other war material. By February 21 German forces
had arrived seventy miles northeast of Riga, and Esthonia was
completely occupied.</p>

<p>By this time it began to dawn on the Bolsheviki leaders in Petrograd
that the Germans meant to occupy all the territory they desired before
they would reopen negotiations. On February 22, 1918, a proclamation
was promulgated, in the following terms:</p>

<p>"We agreed to sign peace terms at the cost of enormous concessions in
order to save the country from final exhaustion and the ruin of the
revolution. Once more the German working class, in this threatening
hour, has shown itself insufficiently determined <span class="pagenum"><a id="page424" name="page424"></a>(p. 424)</span> to stay the
strong criminal hand of its own militarism. We had no other choice
than to accept the conditions of German imperialism until a revolution
changes or cancels them. The German Government is not in a hurry to
reply to us, evidently aiming to seize as many important positions in
our territory as possible. The enemy has occupied Dvinsk, Werder, and
Lutsk, and is continuing to strangle by hunger the most important
centers of the revolution. Even now we are firmly convinced that the
German working class will rise against the attempts of the ruling
class to stifle the revolution, but we cannot predict with certainty
when this will occur.... The Commissaries call on all loyal councils
and army organizations to use all efforts to recreate the army.
Perverted elements of hooligans, marauders and cowards should be
expelled from the ranks, and, in the event of resistance, be wiped out
of existence. The bourgeoisie, who under Kerensky and the Czar evaded
the burden of war and profited from its misfortunes, must be made to
fulfill their duties by the most decisive and merciless measures....
The German generals desire to establish their own order in Petrograd
and Kiev. The republic is in the gravest danger. The duty of Russian
workingmen and peasants is defense to the death of the republic
against the masses of bourgeoisie and imperialists of Germany. German
militarism wishes to smother the working classes and the Ukrainian
masses, to give back the land to the landowners, factories and
workshops to the bankers, and power to a monarchy."</p>

<p>Finally the Germans condescended to open negotiations with the
Russians once more. On February 23, 1918, Foreign Secretary von
Kühlmann opened up communication with Petrograd, offering to arrange a
new peace conference. The terms could not now, of course, be so
generous as were those offered at Brest-Litovsk, the negotiations must
be concluded within forty-eight hours and ratified within two weeks.</p>

<p>As outlined by Von Kühlmann, the new conditions were: Livonia and
Esthonia immediately to be cleared of Russian troops; this territory
to be policed by the Germans until such a time as these countries
should establish governments of their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page425" name="page425"></a>(p. 425)</span> own. An immediate peace
between northern Russia and the Ukrainians. Ukrainia and Finland to be
evacuated by all Russian forces. A complete demobilization of the
Russian armies, including the newly organized Red Guards. Russian
warships in the Black Sea, the Baltic and the Arctic to be interned in
Russian harbors, warships of the Entente Powers to undergo similar
treatment. Merchant navigation of the Black Sea to be renewed. The
Russo-German commercial treaty of 1914 to be enforced again. And all
revolutionary propaganda among German soldiers and civilians to be
stopped immediately and absolutely.</p>

<p>During the entire night of the day on which this communication was
received the Council was in conference, adjourning now and then to
allow party caucuses. At first there was a strong feeling in favor of
resistance, especially among the members of the opposition. Premier
Lenine's influence was thrown strongly in favor of peace and an
unconditional acceptance of the terms which the enemy offered.</p>

<p>In the early morning of Sunday, the 24th, the Central Executive
Committee decided to accept the German terms, by a vote of 112 against
84. The German Government was then informed that a Russian
representative would leave immediately for Dvinsk, carrying with him
the official acceptance of the German terms. A new peace delegation
was elected to attend the coming conference, for both Trotzky and
Joffe, who had been the leaders of the first commission, refused to
serve again. Meanwhile a request had been made to the German military
commander that another armistice be declared, to last until the
conclusion of the peace negotiations. But this request the Germans
flatly refused, and the German armies continued their advance
eastward.</p>

<p>This policy on the part of the Germans, to continue military
aggression to the last moment, finally roused a fighting spirit among
the Bolsheviki organizations. Under the supervision of the Petrograd
Soviet extensive preparations were made to renew armed resistance.
Recruits to the Red Guard regiments were enlisted and armed with
feverish haste and hurried out to the front, to take the place of the
fleeing regulars, who were completely useless and demoralized. Fully
100,000 joined the Red <span class="pagenum"><a id="page426" name="page426"></a>(p. 426)</span> Guard detachments, among them being
many officers of the old army who, without sympathizing with
Bolsheviki principles, joined them from pure patriotism.</p>

<p>The results of these exertions were soon made manifest on the fighting
front, for now came reports indicating that the Germans were obliged
to fight desperately to make any headway. On February 26, 1918, the
Russians made so determined a resistance at and near Pskov that the
Germans were temporarily driven back and halted for several days,
until they could bring up their heavy ordnance.</p>

<p>On March 3, 1918, the Germans announced that they had ceased
hostilities, the Russian delegation to Brest-Litovsk, where the second
conference was held, having signed the peace treaty. They then
reported the capture of 6,800 officers, 57,000 men, 2,400 cannon,
5,000 machine guns, 800 locomotives, and large quantities of other war
material. The territory overrun was all that part of Russia lying west
of a line drawn from Narva, on the Gulf of Finland, due south to Kiev,
including Russian Poland, Lithuania, Esthonia, Livonia, and the
outlying islands in the Gulf of Finland. By refusing to sign a treaty
of peace at the first conference the Russians lost territories
amounting to almost one-quarter of Russia in Europe, inhabited by
about a third of the total population. By the new treaty the Russians
lost Finland, Poland, Ukrainia, Lithuania, Esthonia, Livonia,
Courland, and a portion of Transcaucasia, southeast of the Black Sea.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LX</h2>

<p class="title">THE PEACE TREATY THAT WAS SIGNED</p>


<p>The Russian delegates at the second peace conference had signed
practically blindfolded. Gradually the German terms were given out to
the world. Probably nothing during the war, except the sinking of the
<i>Lusitania</i>, had so contributed to turning sympathy in neutral
countries away from Germany as the conditions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page427" name="page427"></a>(p. 427)</span> which were
forced on Russia. The following summary gives the outstanding features
of the treaty of peace which still exists between Russia and the
Central Powers:</p>

<p>An end to all propaganda among the soldiers and civil populations of
the Central Powers. Russia to relinquish all claims to the territory
occupied and held by the Germans, the fate of these countries to be
decided by Germany. Russia must evacuate the Anatolian provinces taken
from Turkey, as well as the districts of Kars, Erivan and Batum.
Russia must demobilize all her armies. All Russian warships to be
interned in Russian harbors until a general peace has been declared.
Russia must conclude an immediate peace with the Ukrainian Republic
and recognize the treaty of peace between Ukrainia and the Central
Powers. All revolutionary propaganda in Ukrainia must cease. Finland
and the Aland Islands must be evacuated by all Russian armed forces,
both military and naval. A general exchange of prisoners of war is to
be begun at once.</p>

<p>The document presenting these terms had yet to be ratified by the
highest ruling powers in Russia, and, according to the German demands,
within two weeks. Trotzky, hitherto the dominating figure of the
Bolsheviki party, was apparently opposed to the acceptance of the
treaty and refused to be a delegate to the final peace conference, as
already noted. For this reason he also resigned as Foreign Minister,
declaring that he could not agree with the point of view of Lenine,
and was succeeded by Tchitcherin. Trotzky was now made chairman of the
newly created government of Petrograd, known as the Petrograd Labor
Commune, which was responsible "for the safeguarding of revolutionary
order and defending the city from the enemy."</p>

<p>The treaty was presented for ratification to a Pan-Soviet Congress,
held in Moscow on March 14-16, 1918, the Soviet Government being by
this time established in Moscow. The Congress consisted of 1,164
delegates, the majority being soldiers, sailors, and workingmen, with
Bolshevist constituencies in the industrial centers, the peasants
being represented in a much smaller proportion. Of the total number
732 delegates were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page428" name="page428"></a>(p. 428)</span> declared partisans of Lenine; thirty-eight
were Socialist Revolutionists, with more moderate tendencies than the
Bolsheviki.</p>

<p>Again Lenine strongly advocated for peace at any price, contending, as
before, that it would be only a matter of time until the working
classes of the whole world would overthrow their capitalist and
imperial masters and come to the rescue of the Russian proletariat.
The treaty was finally ratified by a vote of 704 against 261. Two
Bolshevist commissaries, Debenko and Kolantai, and four Socialist
Revolutionaries, Steinberg, Kalagaiev, Karelin and Broshian, resigned
their posts in the cabinet when the result was announced.</p>

<p>At the congress the following telegram from President Wilson was read,
at the opening session:</p>

<p>"May I not take advantage of the meeting of the Congress of the
Soviets to express the sincere sympathy which the people of the United
States feel for the Russian people at this moment when the German
power has been thrust in to interrupt and turn back the whole struggle
for freedom and substitute the wishes of Germany for the purpose of
the people of Russia? Although the Government of the United States is,
unhappily, not now in a position to render the direct and effective
aid it would wish to render, I beg to assure the people of Russia
through the Congress that it will avail itself of every opportunity to
secure for Russia once more complete sovereignty and independence in
her own affairs and full restoration to her great rôle in the life of
Europe and the modern world.</p>

<p>"The whole heart of the people of the United States is with the people
of Russia in the attempt to free themselves forever from autocratic
government and become the masters of their own life."</p>

<p>The following day the Congress adopted the following reply to
President Wilson's message of sympathy:</p>

<p>"The Congress expresses its gratitude to the American people, above
all to the laboring and exploited classes of the United States, for
the sympathy expressed to the Russian people by President Wilson
through the Congress of Soviets in the days of severe trials. The
Russian Socialistic Federative Republic of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page429" name="page429"></a>(p. 429)</span> Soviets takes
advantage of President Wilson's communication to express to all
peoples perishing and suffering from the horrors of imperialistic war
its warm sympathy and firm belief that the happy time is not far
distant when the laboring classes of all countries will throw off the
yoke of capitalism and will establish a socialistic state of society,
which alone is capable of securing just and lasting peace as well as
the culture and well-being of all laboring people."</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LXI</h2>

<p class="title">CONTINUED GERMAN AGGRESSION</p>

<p>On the day the Russian delegates to Brest-Litovsk had signed the peace
treaty the Germans had announced an end to military activities on the
eastern front, and until the treaty had been ratified they did indeed
refrain from further aggression. It was even reported that practically
all the German forces on the Russian front had been removed to the
western front and those few that remained would be insufficient to
carry on any further operations, even against the disorganized
Russians. But after the middle of March reports of military operations
began to appear again, the pretext of the Germans being that they were
"establishing order" along the new frontier and were merely
suppressing irresponsible bands.</p>

<p>The Teuton advance was most pronounced in Ukrainia, where the legal
authorities were ostensibly cooperating with the invaders. Apparently
the forces employed in the conquest of this territory were largely the
Slavic contingents of the Austrian Army, supported by the so-called
Ukrainian troops, regiments recruited from the Ukrainians which had
formerly been units of the Russian Army and were now loyal to the
Rada. German officers were in the higher commands, so that the
operations were entirely in the interests of the German Government.</p>

<p>Thus, by the end of the third week in March the Teutons had overrun
all of Ukrainia west of the Dnieper and were in possession <span class="pagenum"><a id="page430" name="page430"></a>(p. 430)</span> of
the chief center, Kiev, as well as the important cities of Zhitomir,
Nikolaiev, and the chief seaport of southern Russia, Odessa.
Bolsheviki Red Guards succeeded in driving the invaders out of Odessa
some days later, but it was again captured on the arrival of Austrian
reenforcements. Over two thousand ships and great quantities of war
material were seized. According to some reports, even the Rada became
alarmed and protested at continuous invasion, but no heed was taken
of the request.</p>

<p>Up in northern Russia there was also continued aggression. An advance
on Petrograd was begun, but when the Soviet Government became
established in Moscow, the Germans switched off in that direction,
especially from the direction of Ukrainia, whose borders with Russia
proper were crossed for a considerable distance, to within 150 miles
of Moscow.</p>

<p>The peace treaty provided for the ceding to the Central Powers of the
Transcaucasian provinces, already mentioned. But here the people had
organized a constituent assembly of their own, which now refused to
recognize this provision of the treaty. Meeting in Tiflis, the
assembly declared for a defensive war, and independence was declared.
In the middle of April the Armenian National Council, in an official
protest addressed to the German Government, said:</p>

<p>"Following upon the withdrawal of the Russian troops Turkish forces
have invaded the undefended country and are not only killing off the
Turkish Armenians, but all the Russians as well. In spite of the terms
of the peace treaty, which recognizes the right of self-determination
for these Caucasian regions, the Turkish Army is advancing toward Kars
and Ardahan, destroying the country and killing the Christian
inhabitants. The responsibility for the future destiny of the
Armenians lies entirely with Germany, because it was Germany's
insistence which resulted in the withdrawal of the Russian troops from
the Armenian regions, and at the moment it rests with Germany to
prevent the habitual excesses of the Turkish troops, increased by
revengefulness and anger."</p>

<p>In Russia, the Bolshevist leaders had actually betrayed their country
to the Germans. In Finland, it was the conservative <span class="pagenum"><a id="page431" name="page431"></a>(p. 431)</span> element
that welcomed the Teutons. Hatred of Russia and fear of the excesses
committed by the extreme Socialists had made the Finns strongly
pro-German. For the Socialists were not only a numerous element in
Finland, but were well organized in the Labor party. In January, 1918,
these radicals, corresponding to the Bolsheviki in Russia, rose in
armed revolt and seized Helsingfors, driving the members of the
Government north, where it established its headquarters at Vasa, under
the leadership of M. Svinhufvud. The Socialists organized a government
of their own in the old capital, the head of their cabinet being
Kullervo Manner. Thus was begun the civil strife with the conservative
White Guards on the one hand and the Socialist Red Guards on the
other, the former receiving German support, the latter being backed by
the moral and a great deal of material support from the Soviet
Government of Russia. The Germans occupied the Aland Islands, March 2,
1918, and in April took Helsingfors and Viborg, cooperating with the
Finnish White Guards. At the end of April, Finland was practically
controlled by Germany. Meantime the Germans were organizing the
conquered provinces taken from Russia.</p>

<p>The continued aggression of the German forces aroused a very bitter
spirit among the Russians. Even Lenine openly declared that the peace
was only for the purpose of reorganizing the war. Trotzky, who at
least outwardly opposed the acceptance of the treaty, came to the fore
again. He declared for the organization of an army of half a million
men on the regular disciplined basis. On April 2, 1918, Podvoisky,
assistant commissary of war, announced that Russia would establish an
army of 1,500,000 men, in which the elective principle would be more
limited, and some of the leaders openly advocated conscription. On
April 10, 1918, Trotzky was again admitted into the cabinet as
minister of war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there were strong indications that a more conciliatory
attitude would be adopted toward the "capitalistic" governments of the
Allies, who had been denounced as only a little less hostile to Russia
than Germany. Tchitcherin, the foreign minister, made the statement
that "Russia's relations toward the Entente are unchanged."</p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page432" name="page432"></a>(p. 432)</span> CHAPTER LXII</h2>

<p class="title">JAPANESE TAKE ACTION IN THE EAST</p>

<p>The Allied Governments, naturally, including that of the United
States, refused to recognize the treaty of peace which Germany and
Austria had imposed on the helpless Russians. It was their recognition
of the helplessness of the Russians which caused them to realize the
fact that Germany might still further force them into a position which
would be detrimental to the Allied cause; that, in a sense, the
Russians were not responsible and that therefore it might become
necessary to take certain measures which would prevent their falling
too far under Teuton control, or permitting Russia to become a vast
storehouse and granary for the Central Powers, which might exploit and
develop Russian resources to further Austrian and German ends. Now
that Russia was not even nominally hostile to Germany, she became a
potential auxiliary instead of a menace to the military success of the
Central Powers.</p>

<p>Just before the collapse of Russia, brought to a climax by the rise
into power of the Bolsheviki, large stores of military supplies from
Japan and the United States had been accumulating at the Vladivostok
terminus of the Siberian Railroad. It was only natural to assume that
it would be Germany's great desire to obtain possession of these
stores. What quickened anticipation of this possibility was the rumor
that large numbers of Austrian and German prisoners had been armed in
Siberia and were gathering along the line of the Siberian Railroad.
Both Lenine and Trotzky denied this report most vigorously and invited
the Allies to send representatives into Siberia to investigate. This
was done, notably by the United States, and the reports of the
investigators seemed to indicate that there had been no foundation to
the rumors.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the danger remained and action became necessary.
Japanese intervention in the East now became a lively subject of
discussion in the Allied countries. On April 5, 1918, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page433" name="page433"></a>(p. 433)</span> two
companies of Japanese marines were put ashore in Vladivostok, the
immediate pretext being some disorders ashore, in which a Japanese
subject had been killed. The local soviet reported that the Japanese
had taken this action on their own initiative, without consulting the
diplomatic representatives of any other of the Allied countries. But a
later report indicated that the British had also landed marines, and
on the following day the Japanese put ashore another small landing
party. The Japanese naval commander, Admiral Kato, issued a
proclamation in which he assumed personal responsibility for the
landing of forces, and stated that it had absolutely no political
significance, the object being merely to protect Japanese lives and
property until the local authorities could guarantee law and order
themselves. The local governing bodies, however, protested vigorously.</p>

<p>The news of the landing produced keen excitement in Moscow and was
construed as the beginning of Japanese intervention in Russian
domestic affairs. On the following day, April 6, 1918, the Soviet
Government issued a statement in which it declared that the murder of
the Japanese subject was part of a pre-arranged plan and that "the
Japanese have started a campaign against the Soviet Republic." Two
days later Premier Lenine said, in a public speech:</p>

<p>"It is possible that, within a short time, perhaps even within a few
days, we shall be compelled to declare war against Japan."</p>

<p>Two days later it was reported that Russia had requested the German
Government to permit postponement of that provision of the peace
treaty which demanded the demobilization of the Russian military
forces, on account of the possible need of defensive military action
against the Japanese.</p>

<p>On April 16, 1918, Mr. Francis, American ambassador to Russia, issued
the following statement:</p>

<p>"The Soviet Government and the Soviet press are giving too much
importance to the landing of these marines, which has no political
significance, but merely was a police precaution taken by the Japanese
admiral on his own responsibility for the protection of Japanese life
and property in Vladivostok, and the Japanese admiral, Kato, so
informed the American admiral, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page434" name="page434"></a>(p. 434)</span> Knight, and the American
consul, Caldwell, in Vladivostok. My impression is that the landing of
the British marines was pursuant to the request of the British consul
for the protection of the British consulate and British subjects in
Vladivostok, which he anticipated would possibly be jeopardized by the
unrest which might result from the Japanese landing. The American
consul did not ask protection from the American cruiser in Vladivostok
Harbor, and consequently no American marines were landed. This,
together with the fact that the French consul at Vladivostok made no
request for protection from the British, American, or Japanese
cruisers in the harbor, unquestionably demonstrates that the landing
of Allied troops is not a concerted action between the Allies."</p>

<p>The fears of the Soviet Government were not completely allayed,
however, for they began to remove the stocks of war material westward,
with the result that on April 20 the Japanese landed still more
marines to reenforce those already on guard ashore.</p>

<p>On April 26, 1918, Tchitcherin, the foreign minister of the Soviet
Government, informed the representatives of the United States, Great
Britain, and France that his Government desired the recall of their
consuls stationed at Vladivostok on account of their participation in
counter-revolutionary plots. He also asked them to set forth their
attitudes toward the Soviet Government. An official report of the
demand for the removal of John K. Caldwell, the American consul at
Vladivostok, was received by the American State Department on May 6,
1918, from Ambassador Francis. The State Department replied that it
had no definite information on which to base such charges and refused
to remove the consul. These charges were largely in relation to the
counter-revolutionary movement which had been instigated by General
Seminov, who had established himself in the Transbaikal and had
gathered around him a number of former officers in the Russian army of
high rank and who were now inspired, either by a hope that a
monarchial form of government might be reestablished, or at least that
a less radical form of government than that of the Bolsheviki might
take its place. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page435" name="page435"></a>(p. 435)</span> Here were gathered also many civilian enemies
of the Bolsheviki, with the same hope of overthrowing them by military
force.</p>

<p>During the middle of April, 1918, hostilities were reopened by General
Kornilov against the Soviet forces, but his campaign from the Cossack
country in the south met with disaster in its incipiency, and Kornilov
was himself badly wounded.</p>

<p>It was also stated that General Dutov, another anti-Bolshevist
Cossack leader, was captured by the Bolshevist troops, and that
Seminov, the leader of the anti-Soviet forces in Siberia, was killed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Germans were continuing their aggressive operations,
largely through Ukrainia, where they were almost completely in
possession of the country. The German Government was evidently keenly
disappointed in its hopes of obtaining food supplies from this region.</p>

<p>If the demanded food supplies were to be had, it was obvious that
stronger measures must be resorted to. In the latter part of April it
was announced officially by the Washington State Department that the
Ukrainian Rada was to be dissolved by the Teuton military commander in
Kiev and another government established in its place.</p>

<p>The pretext came with the "arrest" on April 24, 1918, of a prominent
pro-German banker by an organization calling itself the Committee of
Ukrainian Safety. The German Vice Chancellor, Von Payer, said before
the Main Committee of the Reichstag that this secret society had as
its object the expulsion of the Germans from the country, which it
proposed to accomplish by means of the old terrorist methods employed
in the earlier days of the autocracy. Among the members of the
organization were many men of public prominence, and it was said that
its central executive committee had been meeting in the residence of
the minister of war. The German ambassador had demanded an
investigation, but the Rada would not, or could not, take action.</p>

<p>Within forty-eight hours the commander in chief of the Teuton forces
in Ukrainia, General von Eichhorn, proclaimed a state of "enhanced
protection," tantamount to martial law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page436" name="page436"></a>(p. 436)</span> On April 28, 1918, while the Rada was in session, the doors
to the assembly chamber were suddenly thrown open by German soldiers
and a number of the members of the assembly were seized, among them
being the minister of war. When the president of the Rada protested
against the outrage, he was struck by a soldier and thrown to the
floor.</p>

<p>On the following day a convention of wealthy peasants and landed
gentry, who were holding a convention in the city, proclaimed itself
the government of the land, declared the Rada non-existent, and
proclaimed General Skoropadsky, a strong pro-German and a reactionary,
hetman of Ukrainia, thus giving him practically dictatorial powers,
subject to German approval. The German Government hastened to
recognize the new governing power.</p>

<p>A German tool from the beginning, the Rada had nevertheless failed to
satisfy the German demands because of its democratic form, which
enabled an honest minority within its composition to block the
pro-German majority. With the autocratic powers of the new dictator at
their disposal, the Germans now hoped to accomplish their ends more
effectively, for now they could place the responsibility squarely on
him.</p>

<p>In their drive for food supplies, however, the Teutons were not
disposed to confine themselves to the boundaries of Ukrainia. They
still continued their military expeditions into the territories of the
Soviet Government.</p>

<p>In the early part of June, 1918, the Germans made an advance into the
Roslav region, in the Province of Kursk, taking Roventki. On May 10,
1918, they began an eastward advance, sixty miles wide, between
Valuyki and Zhukovo. On that date they captured Rostov on the Don, an
economic center of great importance, but held it only overnight, as
the next day they were driven back by the Russian Red Guards. Finally,
however, during this period, but on a date not mentioned in the
dispatches, Sebastopol was captured, very little resistance being
offered on this occasion. Here the majority of the ships constituting
the Russian Black Sea fleet were captured, but, according to a German
report, it was found that the ships were in a deplorable condition;
only <span class="pagenum"><a id="page437" name="page437"></a>(p. 437)</span> the battleship <i>Volga</i> and the cruiser <i>Pamyat Mercuria</i>
were in serviceable condition. The rest of the fleet consisted of the
battleship <i>Rostislav</i>, the cruiser <i>Potemkine</i>, and a number of
torpedo boats and submarines and twenty transports. The protected
motor-boat flotilla had already been seized at Odessa, as had been
the new war vessels still lying on the slips in the shipyards. The
latter consisted of a dreadnought of 23,000 tons, two protected
cruisers of 7,600 tons, and two unprotected cruisers.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LXIII</h2>

<p class="title">GERMAN POLICY OF AGGRESSION</p>


<p>The White Guards of Finland, having triumphed over the Socialistic Red
Guards, with the active assistance of German intervention now began to
show a disposition to widen Finnish territory in truly Prussian
fashion. Already in May Finnish and German troops had begun operations
in the direction of the Murman Coast, the main object undoubtedly
being to seize the railway from the interior of Russia to the Arctic
ports of Alexandrovsk and Archangel, where large supplies of war
material were stored. It was stated that a small force of English and
French marines had been landed here and were cooperating with the
Bolshevist Red Guards in defending this territory against Teutonic
invasion; that the war council attached to the local Murman Soviet
consisted of one Russian, an Englishman, and a Frenchman. At any rate,
the German Government made the landing of Allied troops at
Alexandrovsk the pretext for a strong protest to the Soviet
Government. In the early part of June, 1918, the Finnish Government,
in response to communications from the French and English Governments,
informed its ambassador in Stockholm that Finland had no desire to
take possession of the Murman Railroad, but it could not undertake to
forego its ambition to annex Russian Carelia. Apart from the small
number of Russian immigrants in Carelia, the note said, the population
was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page438" name="page438"></a>(p. 438)</span> entirely Finnish and had preserved its national character
during a century of oppression.</p>

<p>"Heretofore it has been impossible for the Finnish Government," the
note continued, "to support these national desires, but the Finnish
Government feels that it cannot for all time disregard its duty to
liberate Carelia from the Bolshevist bands, of Russian and Finnish
origin, which are terrorizing the peaceful population. Intervention
may become necessary for purely defensive reasons, since the
Bolshevist bands are threatening devastation to the territories on the
Finnish border. Many attempts at invasion have already been
repulsed.... Many pathetic appeals have been received from the
Carelians to help them place in order their administrative and
economic life where Russian methods have made all civilizing work
impossible."</p>

<p>The German policy, obviously, where actual conquest was not practical,
was the dismemberment of the former Russian Empire. Every
encouragement was given to the separatist tendency. As an instance,
the German Government was reported to have inquired of the local
Crimean authorities concerning the nationalization of their flag,
which the Soviet Government naturally interpreted as an indication of
the German desire to separate the Taurida Republic from the Russian
Federative Republic.</p>

<p>The annexation of Bessarabia to Rumania was another German intrigue to
diminish the territory of the Russians. According to a Rumanian report
on April 9, 1918, the National Assembly of Bessarabia had voted for
annexation to Rumania, by a vote of 86 against 3. The Rumanian Premier
had then proclaimed the union to be "definitive and indissoluble," and
a delegation was sent to Jassy to present the homage of the people of
Bessarabia to the Rumanian king. This action was taken at the
suggestion of Germany, that Rumania might partly compensate herself
for the loss of territory to Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, according
to the conditions of the peace she had signed with the Central Powers.
Previously, in March, Russia and Rumania had agreed that Bessarabia
was to be evacuated by Rumanian troops, whence they had gone to
establish "law and order" at the request of the population, or, more
accurately, the landed gentry, who desired <span class="pagenum"><a id="page439" name="page439"></a>(p. 439)</span> them as a
protection against Bolshevism. Local militia was to take the place of
the Rumanian troops of occupation, while military garrisons were to be
occupied by Russian troops. Russia undertook to leave Rumania the
surplus of Bessarabian grain remaining after the population and the
Russian troops had been provided for. All these arrangements were now
revoked through German intrigues.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the captured provinces of Esthonia and Livonia were
given a comparatively free hand by the Germans, the understanding
being that they should remain in the Russian Federative Republic, if
their populations so desired. Yet here Germany endeavored to
accomplish by propaganda what she did not choose to attain by armed
force.</p>

<p>In March, 1918, the Lithuanians had organized a provisional
government, which immediately demanded recognition of Germany.</p>

<p>On May 5, 1918, the British Government granted an informal recognition
to the Esthonian Provisional Government, and, as stated by Mr.
Balfour, reaffirmed a "readiness to grant provisional recognition to
the Esthonian National Council as a de facto independent body until
the peace conference, when the future status of Esthonia ought to be
settled as far as possible in accordance with the wishes of the
population."</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LXIV</h2>

<p class="title">GERMANY'S APPEAL TO CLASS HATREDS</p>


<p>A survey of the geographical position of the Murman Peninsula and its
harbors will show at a glance the strategic and economic importance of
this region and explain the keen desire of the Germans to obtain a
foothold here. The Murman Coast is that section of the Arctic shore
stretching from the frontier of Russia with Norway, at the mouth of
the Voryema River; to Cape Svyatov, on the White Sea, a distance of
about 250 miles. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page440" name="page440"></a>(p. 440)</span> On the west the coast is a succession of
precipitous cliffs and bluffs, pierced by a number of deep inlets, of
fiords, several of which are excellent harbors for large ships. An
inward sweep of the Gulf Stream washes the shore, keeping it free of
ice the year around, though the White Sea, to the southward, is
icebound six months of the year.</p>

<p>On this account it was long ago planned to connect this ice-free piece
of coast with the interior of Russia by means of a railroad, but the
project never went beyond paper until the beginning of the present
war, when it suddenly assumed unusual importance. It was realized that
practically all other Russian ports would be closed to commerce, but
that the Murman Coast could still be reached by an open sea route. In
the winter after the outbreak of hostilities the construction of the
railroad to Kola was begun and completed by the fall of the following
year, 1916. The railroad, which is about 800 miles in length, runs
from Petrozavodsk to the little port of Kem, on the White Sea. Here it
follows the coast to Kandalaska, also on the White Sea, whence it
crosses the Kola Peninsula to the Port of Kola. This terminal port can
be reached by ship from England quicker than Petrograd, while the
route from New York is twenty-four hours shorter than from New York to
Libau.</p>

<p>While this railroad remains in Russian hands, Russia has an open trade
route with the outside world. Possession of this railroad would give
the Germans control of this open doorway and so increase the strength
of their economic grip on Russia. Furthermore, it would prove an
invaluable base for submarine warfare.</p>

<p>As already stated, the Finnish-German forces began operations in this
direction in April, and the Allies immediately landed a small force of
marines to support the Red Guard defense of this important region. In
June, 1918, the Finns and Germans resumed their advance on the
railroad, heading for the important stations of Kem and Kandalaska.
According to one report, the Germans had completed a railroad to Kem,
along which they proposed to transport some 40,000 troops, stationed
at Viborg. Lenine was disposed to make concessions at this point to
the Germans. The local population, which is largely Russian, was
violently <span class="pagenum"><a id="page441" name="page441"></a>(p. 441)</span> opposed to German invasion. On July 7, 1918, it was
reported that the people of the Murman Coast had risen against the
Soviet Government, declared themselves independent, and appealed to
the Allies for protection.</p>

<p>French, English, and American forces were immediately landed, in spite
of the strong protest of the Moscow Government. As a matter of
record, before landing, the British commander of the landing forces
had requested permission of the Soviet Government, which had been
immediately granted by Trotzky, minister of war. The protest which
followed was therefore compelled by German pressure, which was applied
so strongly that the Soviet Government made a show of mobilizing a
special army for transportation to the Murman Coast.</p>

<p>After the landing of the American forces, in the early part of July,
1918, the Allied troops advanced on Kem and occupied that port, then
continued on toward Toroki, the Bolshevist forces there withdrawing to
Nirok. By the end of July, 1918, the whole Murman Coast had been
occupied by the Allied troops, the German-Finnish forces, amounting to
about a division, being too far south to offer any opposition.
According to one dispatch General Gurko, one of the chief commanders
of the Russian troops in the days before the revolution, had been
placed in command of the Murman Coast army. It was also said that an
appeal had been made for the support of the local population, which
was being given with hearty enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The grip which Germany had taken on Finland was indicated when even so
strong a reactionary as General Mannerheim, commander of the Finnish
White Guards, resigned early in July, 1918, and left the country for
Stockholm. Here he stated publicly that Finland had practically become
a territory of the German Empire and would remain so unless expelled
by force. He added that he was waiting for the opportune moment to
rally the patriotic Finns against the Germans. Said Hugo Haase, leader
of the German minority Socialists, in a speech in the Reichstag:</p>

<p>"The list of those sentenced to death in Finland contains the names of
a former premier and fifty Socialists, members of Parliament, some of
whom have already been shot. Owing to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page442" name="page442"></a>(p. 442)</span> number of daily
executions in the town of Sveaborg that place has been renamed
'Golgotha.'"</p>

<p>The Finnish Constitutional Committee, by a vote of 16 against 15, has
decided on a monarchial form of government, and the new constitution
is being drafted accordingly.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LXV</h2>

<p class="title">ASSASSINATION OF THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR</p>


<p>The policy of Lenine, as has already been noted, was one of protesting
acquiescence to German outrage and demands; he snarled and assumed
indignation, but complied. But this attitude was not by any means
participated in by all the radicals. Even Trotzky, it will be
remembered, had resigned his post as foreign minister because he had
been unable to agree with Lenine on this point.</p>

<p>It was among that ultraradical group, the Socialist Revolutionists,
that bitterness against Germany glowed hottest, so hot that its
members, though having much in sympathy with the Bolsheviki, split
away from them on the peace policy. Kerensky himself had been of this
school of politics. In the early days of the autocracy, before the
war, it had been this group which had carried on those terrorist
activities which had given the Russian Revolution so bad a name among
the conservatives of all countries.</p>

<p>Again they resolved to resort to these methods. On July 6, 1918,
General Count von Mirbach, the German ambassador to Moscow, was
assassinated by members of the Socialist Revolutionist Party.</p>

<p>Among others of the prominent Socialist Revolutionary leaders who were
said to have been seized for this crime were Tseretelli, Chernov,
Skobelev, and Savinkov, all of whom had been members of the Kerensky
Cabinet. On July 12, 1918, it was reported that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page443" name="page443"></a>(p. 443)</span> Chernov was
marching on Moscow at the head of an army of peasants.</p>

<p>Contrary to general belief in the Allied countries, Germany was
inclined to hold the Lenine Government blameless of the murder of
Count von Mirbach, for on July 10, 1918, the Berlin Government
announced that it did not intend to hold the Soviet responsible. "The
German Government and the nation," the dispatch added, "hope that the
Russian Government and people will succeed in nipping the present
revolutionary agitation in the bud." In a speech on July 11, 1918, Von
Hertling, after having laid the blame to the intrigues of the Allies,
said:</p>

<p>"We do not want fresh war with Russia. The present Russian Government
wants peace and needs peace, and we are giving it support in this
peaceful disposition and aim. On the other hand, it is true that
political currents of very varied tendencies are circulating in
Russia&mdash;movements having the most diverse aims, including the
monarchist movement of the Constitutional Democrats and the movement
of the Socialist Revolutionaries. We will not commit ourselves to any
political countercurrent, but are giving careful attention to the
course Russia is steering."</p>

<p>Apparently the personality of Von Mirbach had also something to do
with his assassination, for as an intriguer he was reported to be
absolutely without conscience. After his death the Constitutional
Democrats made an official statement to the effect that he had called
to him representatives of their party and, while professing to be
upholding the Lenine Government, promised them German aid in
overthrowing the Bolsheviki under certain conditions. Germany, he told
them, desired a more conservative government in Russia, and if the
Constitutional Democrats would be willing to establish a monarchy,
under German influence, then they might expect a substantial revision
of the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty, to the advantage of Russia. This
offer the Constitutional Democrats had indignantly refused.</p>

<p>Not alone in Great Russia was it that the bitter hatred of the Germans
was breaking out into flames. In the middle of June, 1918, it was
reported from Kiev that the peasants were breaking out into local
disorders and attacking the soldiers who <span class="pagenum"><a id="page444" name="page444"></a>(p. 444)</span> were protecting the
wheat-gathering expeditions. A dispatch dated in June, 1918, indicated
that these disorders had taken on a more general and better organized
aspect; that 40,000 peasants were assembled in an army and were
entering the streets of the capital, where they were attacking the
garrison and exploding artillery munitions. Later dispatches indicated
that the revolt had spread into the Poltava and Chernigov districts,
and ten days later the number of armed and officered insurgents was
said to number 200,000. At the village of Krinichki, in the province
of Ekaterinoslav, the peasants attacked the Germans in big force and a
pitched battle took place, the Germans being driven back with a loss
of over 1,000 men. In response to a call from the German commander in
Kiev it was reported that Germany was obliged to send over a quarter
of a million men to reenforce the German and Austrian forces in
Ukrainia.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LXVI</h2>

<p class="title">THE MARCH OF THE CZECHO-SLOVAKS THROUGH SIBERIA</p>


<p>By far the most picturesque of the events occurring in Russia during
June and July, 1918, was the so-called Czecho-Slovak movement.</p>

<p>In the earlier periods of the war, but especially after the first
revolution, in March, 1917, great numbers of Czechs, or Bohemians, and
Slovaks, in the Austrian Army, had surrendered to the Russians
voluntarily, on account of their hatred of Austria. The Bohemians and
Slovaks are Slavs by race, so closely allied racially to the Russians
that they are able to converse together with little difficulty. Whole
regiments of them had come over to the Russians, en masse, and were
enrolled as special regiments in the Russian Army.</p>

<p>Shortly before the Brest-Litovsk Peace Conference the French
Government requested the Lenine Cabinet to equip and send on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page445" name="page445"></a>(p. 445)</span>
their way for the western front these Slavic soldiers of the Russian
Army. This request was granted by the Soviet Government, and the
Czechs and Slovaks, said to number 100,000, were allowed to retain
their arms and entrain for France, via the Siberian Railroad.</p>

<p>At this time the Czecho-Slovak troops were decidedly not opposed to
the Bolsheviki; on the contrary, most of them were known to be
Socialists, and their sympathies were inclined to be in favor of all
radical Russians. Upon hearing that this large body of soldiers was to
leave Russia for the western front, Germany, naturally, raised a
strong protest after the signing of the peace treaty. By this time the
Czecho-Slovaks were en route on Siberian territory.</p>

<p>As to the cause of the friction which arose between them and the
Soviet Government forces, there are two versions. One side contends
that German pressure forced the Bolsheviki to endeavor to disarm the
Czecho-Slovaks and intern them again. This effort was violently
resisted and led to open hostilities.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviki affirm that the request of the French Government was
not made in good faith; that behind it was an intrigue whose object
was to make of the Czecho-Slovaks an armed force which should be the
nucleus of an uprising against the Soviet in Russia. At an opportune
moment the Czecho-Slovaks were to attack the Red Guards, hoping to
rally around them all the anti-Bolsheviki forces in Russia, and so
cause an overthrow of the Soviet.</p>

<p>Whatever the truth may be, open hostilities began on May 26, 1918,
when Czecho-Slovak forces began operations in the Volga district and
in Siberia simultaneously. Early in June, 1918, they had taken
possession of a considerable stretch of territory in the Volga
district, including several important towns. At about the same time
some thousands of them, arriving at the terminus of the railroad, in
Vladivostok, precipitated an uprising there and took possession of the
city. On June 9 and 10, 1918, they occupied Samara and advanced to
Ufa, in the Urals, where they were able to seize the railroads by
which European Russia obtained its food supplies from Siberia. By the
middle of June, 1918, they <span class="pagenum"><a id="page446" name="page446"></a>(p. 446)</span> were in control of the southern
section of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, from Samara to Chelyabinsk,
the northern branch from Chelyabinsk to Ekaterinburg, and the main
line on the east of Novonikolaiefsk. Some weeks later they held the
railroad from Chelyabinsk, in the Ural Mountains, to Krasnoyarsk, a
distance of 1,300 miles, as well as its eastern terminus, while
scattered units of the Czecho-Slovak army stretched clear across
Siberia.</p>

<p>On June 30, 1918, a pitched battle was fought with the Red Guards at
the important city of Irkutsk, in Siberia, from which the local
Bolshevist soviet was ousted. On the same day the last of the
Bolsheviki were driven out of Vladivostok, the fighting being so
severe that the Japanese and English warships in the harbor were
obliged to land marines to protect the Allied consulates. Having
established themselves in Vladivostok, the Czecho-Slovaks advanced
into the Amur region and took Nikolaiefsky, on the Amur River, besides
a number of other towns. By the middle of July, 1918, most of the
Trans-Siberian Railroad was in the hands of the Czecho-Slovaks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Czecho-Slovaks in the Volga region were also engaged in
heavy fighting with the Soviet troops. On July 9, 1918, the Soviet
Government announced that it had delivered a heavy defeat to the
Czecho-Slovaks at Bugulma, the enemy fleeing in the direction of
Samara. Another dispatch stated that Muraviev, the commander of a
large force of Soviet troops, suddenly decided to go over to the enemy
and march with them on Moscow. When his soldiers refused to obey him,
he committed suicide.</p>

<p>The commander in chief of the Czecho-Slovak forces in Russia is the
Russian General Dieterichs, who was chief of staff under Dukhonin,
after the fall of Kerensky. In a statement addressed to the American
representative of the Finnish People's Republic, the Czech Socialist
Federation of the United States insisted that the Czecho-Slovak
movement in Russia was in no way connected with counter-revolutionary
intrigues tending toward a reestablishment of the autocracy, or of a
constitutional monarchy, the great majority of the Czecho-Slovaks
being themselves Socialists. Professor Masaryk, representing the
movement in Washington, says:</p>

<a id="img028" name="img028"></a>

guests of our brothers in Russia and we will not interfere in their
internal affairs."</p>

<p>On July 10, 1918, a new, autonomous Siberian Government was
proclaimed, with headquarters at Novonikolaiefsk, on the River Ob. The
new government, while anti-Bolshevist, is radical in character and is
based on universal suffrage and a constituent assembly representing
all classes of the population.</p>

<p>On the same date, July 10, 1918, General Horvath, vice president of
the Chinese Eastern Railroad, proclaimed himself military dictator of
another government of Siberia. He established his headquarters at
Harbin.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LXVII</h2>

<p class="title">EXECUTION OF EX-CZAR NICHOLAS</p>


<p>Since the latter part of June, 1918, there had been frequent rumors to
the effect that ex-Czar Nicholas had been executed. The first of these
stated that he had been killed by Red Guards at Ekaterinburg. This
dispatch was denied officially, but was followed by another report
that the ex-Czar had been tried and executed by the Bolsheviki at the
city of the same name. This report was confirmed apparently by advices
reaching the Washington State Department.</p>

<p>The next report was what purported to be an intercepted wireless
message from the Soviet Foreign Minister Tchitcherin, in which it was
stated that Nicholas was dead. Still another report had it that he had
been bayoneted by Red Guards while being taken from Ekaterinburg to
Perm.</p>

<p>On July 20 an official statement was issued from Moscow which stated
definitely that the one-time autocrat of Russia had been shot on July
16, 1918.</p>

<p>The most prominent issue regarding Russian affairs which has been
before the public of the United States and the other <span class="pagenum"><a id="page448" name="page448"></a>(p. 448)</span> Allied
countries during the past month or more has been the question of
extending assistance to Russia in reestablishing herself as a free,
independent nation, with the power to resist German aggression;
whether this should be done through active military intervention from
the east, or whether it should be confined to economic and financial
aid. On this point there has been a wide division of opinion, not only
in this country, but among Russians as well.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviki, naturally, are strongly opposed to any military aid,
which they would interpret as an attempt on the part of the
capitalists of the Allied countries to suppress the socialistic state
which they claim to have erected on Russian soil.</p>

<p>The membership of the Great Russian Cooperative Movement, expressing
its views through its leaders and its official organs, is also opposed
to military intervention, having small faith in the benevolent
intentions of the Japanese Government. The cooperators, however,
realize the danger from German economic control and have been fighting
it with intensive effort. The Narodni Bank and the Consumers' Union,
in Moscow, have opened offices in London and New York, and have opened
a campaign for British and American aid in their efforts to stem the
German economic invasion. The contention of their representatives is
that the cooperative movement of Russia is a weapon which could be
used by the Allied countries to great advantage, and should be aided
in an extension of credit and loans of capital, with which their
cooperative industrial system might be developed to such dimensions as
to form an invincible bulwark against the flood of German capital
flowing into Russia.</p>

<p>So far as reports from Russia indicated, the Russians in favor of
military intervention by the Allies were largely among the
conservative elements, represented by the Constitutional Democrats,
and among those comparatively moderate radicals represented by
Kerensky and Konovalov. The first group are largely of the
professional classes and the so-called bourgeoisie who have not been
able to bring themselves to prefer German dominance to even the
disorders of Bolshevikism. Among the second group are many of the
old-time revolutionists, such as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page449" name="page449"></a>(p. 449)</span> Tchaikovsky, Prince
Kropotkin, Katherine Breshkovskaya, Vladimir Bourtsev and Maria
Spiradonova. These latter are, most of them, of the old Social
Revolutionary Party.</p>

<p>On July 31, 1918, the New York "Times" published the following
Washington dispatch:</p>

<p>"Negotiations between the Entente Powers, Japan, and the United States
regarding the extension of aid to the Czecho-Slovaks in Siberia and
Russia have advanced another step. Information sought by the Japanese
Government upon certain points of the American proposal looking to a
definition of the aims and scope of any joint action now has been
furnished by the State Department. This places the whole subject again
before the Japanese Foreign Office at Tokio, which must determine
whether the American proposal is now in a sufficiently concrete form
to warrant the inauguration of a policy of action.... Meanwhile, from
unofficial sources, comes news that in anticipation of a satisfactory
conclusion of the negotiations, Japan and the Entente Allies are
perfecting their arrangements for the organization of whatever
military force may be necessary for the execution of the joint
agreement. Because of their proximity to Siberia, Japan and China have
been foremost in this work, with a full understanding and cooperation
between the military commanders, though for strategic reasons the
exact extent and nature of these preparations cannot be disclosed. It
is generally realized, however, that upon these two countries will lie
the burden of providing the greater part of any military force that
may be employed. To preserve the international character of the
enterprise France and Great Britain are preparing contingents. Both of
them will draw on their near-by colonies."</p>

<p>By the end of July, 1918, it was practically certain that the United
States Government had consented to participate in a limited military
expedition into Russia, by way of Siberia, not for the purpose of
conquest or interference in the internal affairs of the Russian
Republic, but to create a nucleus about which all the anti-German
forces of Russia might rally for the reestablishment of an eastern
front against Germany.</p>


<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page450" name="page450"></a>(p. 450)</span> PART XI&mdash;AUSTRO-ITALIAN CAMPAIGN</h2>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LXVIII</h2>

<p class="title">ITALY REVIVES</p>


<p>After the few local engagements which, during the last few days of
January, 1918, resulted in some slight Italian gains and a
corresponding improvement of the Italian positions in some sectors,
comparatively little of importance happened during the first half of
February, 1918. On the first of that month the Italians succeeded in
advancing their lines to the head of the Melago Valley, while an
attempt on the part of the Austro-Hungarian forces to reach the
Italian lines by means of a drive against the Italian position on
Monte di Val Bella failed.</p>

<p>Artillery fire was the extent of military operations on February 2 and
3, 1918, being restricted on the first of these two days to the Asiago
Plateau and the front east of the Brenta, but spreading on the next
day along the entire front.</p>

<p>During the next few days the outstanding feature was increased aerial
activity on both sides. On February 4, 5, 6, and 7, 1918, Italian and
British airplanes made repeated successful attacks against the
Austrian positions and a number of Austrian aviation grounds. On the
other hand the Austrians bombed repeatedly Venice, Mestre, Treviso,
Calviano, and Bassano. On some of these days there were also artillery
duels and outpost actions, although the weather seriously interfered
with military operations almost along the entire front.</p>

<p>Lively artillery duels and concentrations of fire in the Val Brenta
and in the Mt. Melago and Mt. Asolone areas occurred during February
8, 1918. Austrian patrols attempting a surprise <span class="pagenum"><a id="page451" name="page451"></a>(p. 451)</span> attack
against some Italian troops were repulsed by hand-grenade fire.
Between the Posina and the Astico, east of Lake Garda, and along the
coast, Italian reconnoitering parties effectively harassed the
Austrian outposts. During the evening two infantry attacks in force
were attempted by the Austrians south of Daone, west of Lake Garda,
but failed under the heavy fire of the Italian advanced posts.</p>

<p>Along the whole front fighting activity was confined on February 9,
1918, to artillery actions, more intense and frequent in the eastern
sector of the Asiago Plateau and in the area west of Mt. Grappa.</p>

<p>On February 10, 1918, very violent concentrations of fire and
offensive thrusts of infantry were repeatedly carried out by the
Austrians to the east and west of Val Frenzela, at the eastern end of
the Sette Comuni, or Asiago Plateau.</p>

<p>At the new Italian positions of Mt. Val Bella and Col del Rosso, four
and a half miles east of Asiago, Austrian attacks were promptly
frustrated by the very effective fire of the Italian batteries.
Farther to the east, on the southern slopes of Mt. Sasso Rosso, seven
miles northeast of Asiago, Austrian detachments made various attempts
to reach, under the protection of fire, some advanced trenches in
front of the Italian lines, which had been evacuated, but they did not
succeed, owing to the deadly Italian barrage fire.</p>

<p>On February 13, 1918, it was semiofficially announced that the British
part of the battle line on the Italian front had been lengthened
considerably east of the Montello ridge along the Piave and extended
then some miles east of Nervesa.</p>

<p>Opposite the Montello, on February 15, 1918, British reconnoitering
parties crossed the Piave and reached the Austrian lines. There were
the usual artillery actions in the plains; one of the Italian patrols,
starting from the bridgehead of Capo Sile (northeast corner of
Venetian lagoons), surprised an Austrian post, killed or put to flight
its garrison, and returned without losses, bringing back the captured
arms.</p>

<p>Lively artillery actions took place in February 16, 1918, to the west
of Lake Garda, to the east of the Brenta, and on the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page452" name="page452"></a>(p. 452)</span> Middle
Piave. Allied batteries carried out effective concentrations of fire
on Austrian movements east of Val Frenzela and on the back slopes of
Col della Berretta, two miles east of Brenta. In the Val Lagarina,
east of Lake Garda and south of Canove on the Asiago Plateau, Austrian
reconnoissance parties were repulsed by rifle fire.</p>

<p>Between the Posina and the Astico Italian patrols, on February 16,
1918, displayed increased activity, and small caliber batteries
harassed with frequent bursts of fire Austrian movements in the basin
of Laghi. On the Asiago Plateau Allied artillery fired on Austrian
troops marching along the Galmarara Valley, and carried out
concentrations of fire on the sector Val Frenzela-Val Brenta; the
Austrians repeatedly shelled Italian positions on the eastern edge.
Between the Brenta and the Piave there was a reciprocal cannonade at
the salient of Mt. Solarolo. Allied patrols carried out effective
harassing actions against the Austrian advanced posts at Grave di
Papadofoli. Along the coast region the Austrians intensified the
artillery fire at different points, and pushed various patrols toward
Cortellazzo, at the mouth of the Piave. They were, however, driven
back by the hand-grenade fire of the sailors who garrisoned the
bridgehead.</p>

<p>Again on February 18, 1918, artillery activities greatly increased,
especially toward the eastern edge of the Asiago Plateau, and
occasionally in the Val Giudicaria, west of Lake Garda, in the
Posina-Astico sector, east of Lake Garda, on the front of Mt. Tomba,
west of the Piave, and to the south of Ponte della Priula, on the
Piave.</p>

<p>Italian batteries opened a sudden fire in strong Austrian parties in
the Galmarara and Seren valleys and dispersed them. French batteries
carried out effective concentration fire along their sector of the
front. British patrols, having forded the Piave, raided the Austrian
advanced trenches.</p>

<p class="smcap">The Austrian offensive and the Italian
counteroffensive, June-August, 1918.</p>
</div>

<p>During the next few days aerial activity became especially marked.
Austrian aviation grounds were bombed successfully by British and
Italian squadrons. Austrian airplanes, too, were more active. Padua,
Vicenza, Mestre, and Venice were bombed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page454" name="page454"></a>(p. 454)</span> repeatedly and
suffered considerable material damage, in spite of the efficient work
of Italian antiaircraft batteries.</p>

<p>During February 21, 1918, the Austrians shelled with greater
frequency the southeastern slopes of Montello. At the Grave Austrian
scouting parties were driven back. An English patrol had an encounter
with an important group of the Austrian forces on the left bank of the
Piave. Italian patrols having advanced as far as the islet of Folina
in the Middle Piave, brought back two machine guns.</p>

<p>Along the whole front a moderate struggle of artillery and lively
activity by Italian and Austrian scouting parties were maintained
during February 22, 1918. British patrols made a few prisoners. At the
bottom of Val Brenta an Austrian force, which was trying to seize one
of the small Italian posts, was repulsed after a spirited fight.</p>

<p>Lively reciprocal cannonading from the Adige to the Astico, moderate
fire actions along the rest of the front, and intense aerial activity
over the first lines was the order of the day for February 23, 1918.
At Lagoscuro, Val Camonica, and at Rivalta, Brenta, Austrian patrols
were repulsed. On the left bank of the Piave a British patrol attacked
an Austrian force, causing considerable losses. At Capo Sile, the
northeast corner of the Venetian lagoons, Austrian parties, who over a
large tract of the front were trying to attack the bridgehead, were
promptly dispersed.</p>

<p>The balance of February and the first week of March, 1918, brought
extraordinary bad weather, restricting all military operations. There
were, of course, in spite of the weather the usual local engagements
between patrols. Aerial activity had to be given up practically
entirely. Artillery activity, too, was more moderate, increasing from
time to time along various sectors of the front.</p>

<p>Much the same conditions continued during the second and third weeks
of March, 1918. Artillery activity increased occasionally in some
sectors, as for instance during March 8, 1918, along the mountainous
front from the Adige to the Piave. Austrian troops and working parties
were shelled on the Plateau <span class="pagenum"><a id="page455" name="page455"></a>(p. 455)</span> of Tonezza, at the Assa-Astico
confluence, and at the head line of Val Frenzela. Counterattacks were
carried out by the Austrian artillery with more liveliness in the
southern region of the Montello, but showed less activity along the
rest of the front.</p>

<p>More or less unsuccessful air raids were made by Austrian planes
against Naples and Venice on March 10, 1918. Reconnoissance combats
were daily occurrences at many points of the front. Artillery duels of
varying extent and violence, too, were reported every day, without,
however, causing material changes on either side.</p>

<p>Much the same conditions continued during the last week of March,
1918. There were frequent local engagements between patrols and other
small units at many points along the entire front.</p>

<p>The conclusion of peace with Russia, of course, was an important
factor in the further development of affairs in the Austro-Italian
theater of war. Large bodies of troops, formerly employed on the
Austro-Russian front, became available for the Austro-Italian front.
As early as March 28, 1918, it was reported that forty
Austro-Hungarian divisions had been transferred from the eastern to
the Italian front.</p>

<p>However, there were no immediate developments of any importance.
Throughout a great part of April, 1918, the weather was very bad.
Again there were daily actions between patrols and reconnoissance
detachments. Artillery activity at times became very powerful,
suffering on the whole, however, from the inability of the air service
to function at its best on account of the bad weather.</p>

<p>During May, 1918, too, there was little change, though fighting
increased in violence and frequency. The Italians gained some local
successes, notably the capture on May 9, 1918, of a strongly organized
Austrian position on the 6,000 feet high Monte Corno in the Vallarsa,
southeast of Rovereto; advances in the region of Capo Sile, the
northeast corner of the Venetian lagoons on May 20 and 21, 1918, and
again during the night of May 26 and 27, 1918; and the capture on May
25 to 27, 1918, by Alpini of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page456" name="page456"></a>(p. 456)</span> a number of strongly fortified
Austrian positions, located at a great height in the Tonale region,
some twenty miles south of the southeast corner of Switzerland.</p>

<p>During the first half of June, 1918, the same kind of spasmodic
fighting was the order of the day. If there was any change as
compared with the previous months, it consisted of a slight tendency
on the part of the Austrians to be more aggressive. Indeed, toward the
middle of the month this tendency increased considerably and, as a
result, rumors began to be heard of an approaching new Austrian
offensive.</p>

<p>Before long the storm broke. On June 15, 1918, the Austrians launched
their new offensive on a front of about 100 miles, from the Asiago
Plateau to the mouth of the Piave. For a few days it seemed as if they
might be successful. On June 16, 1918, they succeeded in crossing the
Piave at a number of points near Nervesa, Fagare, and Musile, ten,
eight, and fifteen miles respectively north, northeast, and east of
Treviso. On that day the Italians also were forced to give way at the
Sette Comuni Plateau, and immediately to the east in the region of
Monte Asolone and Monte Grappa. Later, however, they were able to
reestablish their lines.</p>

<p>On June 17, 1918, the Austrians were checked by Italian and British
troops in the mountains east of the Sette Comuni, but were able to
extend their gains at the other end of the front, west and south of
Musile, where they succeeded in capturing Capo Sile.</p>

<p>Still less successful were they on the next day, June 18, 1918; again
they were repulsed at the eastern end of the Asiago Plateau, and an
attempt to cross the Piave at still another point, between Maserada
and Cardelu, about three miles northwest of Fagare, resulted in
enormous losses.</p>

<a id="img030" name="img030"></a>

<p class="smcap">The "Montello" where the Austrian offensive broke
down.</p>
</div>

<p>The Italian resistance grew stronger now day by day. It was helped
considerably by heavy rains which created flood conditions at many
points along the Piave. All attempts of the Austrians to gain new
crossings were repulsed with heavy losses to their troops. By June 20,
1918, it became clear that the Italians had regained the initiative
and were attacking furiously <span class="pagenum"><a id="page458" name="page458"></a>(p. 458)</span> at the few points where the
Austrians had gained territory in the first two or three days of their
offensive. From the Montello heights, west of Nervesa, the battle
continued bitterly and without pause. On June 20, 1918, the Austrians
were forced to retire their lines on the Montello and from part of
the Capo Sile sector. British, French, and Czecho-Slovak troops were
of great help to the Italian forces, and American aviators, who had
hurriedly been sent from France, began to operate against the
Austrians.</p>

<p class="smcap">Austro-Italian operations on the lower Piave river.</p>
</div>

<p>On June 21, 1918, the Italian pressure increased still more along the
entire front. Approximately one-half of the recently gained ground had
to be given up again by the Austrians. All efforts to counterattack
were promptly repelled.</p>

<p>The next day began the hurried retreat of the Austrians, and by June
24, 1918, even the official Austrian announcement acknowledged the
evacuation of the entire right bank of the Piave. Thousands of
prisoners, many guns and machine guns and a large amount of other
booty fell into the hands of the closely pressed Italians. On the same
day Nervesa was reoccupied by the Italians. A strong and successful
offensive was started by them in the mountains between the Piave and
the Brenta on June 25, 1918. Day by day now the Austrians had to yield
ground, not only that gained by their last offensive, but positions
that they had held for a considerable time.</p>

<p>Monte di Val Bella was stormed by Italians, French, and British on
June 30, 1918. Col del Rosso and the Col d'Echele, south of Asiago,
fell on July 1, 1918, Monte Grappa, somewhat farther east, on July 2,
1918.</p>

<p>On July 4, 1918, the Italians gained more ground in the most southern
part of the front, near the sea, where a long-drawn-out struggle had
been going on in the region of the Piave delta. By July 6, 1918, all
the coastal zone between the Sile and Piave, stubbornly held by the
Austrians since November, 1917, was again in the hands of the
Italians. The latter claimed that between June 15 and July 6, 1918,
they had captured 523 officers and 23,911 men, sixty-three guns,
sixty-five trench mortars, 1,234 machine guns, and a vast amount of
material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page459" name="page459"></a>(p. 459)</span> During the balance of July, 1918, there was not a great deal
more fighting on the Italian front. On July 8, 1918, the Italians
extended their lines in the Monte Grappa and Col Caprile regions.
Austrian attacks against the Cornone slopes on July 13, 1918, were
promptly repulsed. The French gained some ground by a surprise attack
near Bertigo and Zocchi, and on July 20, 1918, the Italians recaptured
Monte Stabel and reoccupied Corno di Caverto. From then on the
fighting on the Italian front simmered down again to local engagements
between opposing patrols and reconnoissance detachments and to
artillery and aeroplane duels.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page460" name="page460"></a>(p. 460)</span> PART XII&mdash;THE WAR ON THE SEA</h2>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LXIX</h2>

<p class="title">NAVAL WARFARE</p>


<p>The submarine blockade was continued by the Germans during the
six-months' period, February 1 to August 1, 1918, but with
considerably smaller results. Figures, as in the past, were difficult
to compile, and as the war progressed this difficulty increased.
However, the British Admiralty officially announced that during the
eleven months&mdash;March, 1917, to January, 1918, inclusive&mdash;a total of
1,239 British ships had been sunk by mines or torpedoes, an average of
112.6 ships per month and an average of 25.1 ships per week. Beginning
with February, 1918, losses became very much smaller, partly on
account of the greater number of submarines sunk or captured by the
Allies, and partly on account of the ever-increasing efficiency of the
submarine-chasing and convoy services.</p>

<p>In April, 1918, the British Admiralty discontinued its weekly report
of merchant ships destroyed by mines or torpedoes, and substituted a
monthly report in terms of tonnage. The following figures are taken
from the official British reports and show the steadily decreasing
success of submarine warfare:</p>

<p>On February 5, 1918, the British liner <i>Tuscania</i> (Captain J. L.
Henderson), serving as a transport for American troops, was sunk by a
submarine off the coast of Ireland. The <i>Tuscania</i> carried 2,177 U. S.
soldiers of whom 117 were officers, 2 civilians, 2 naval ratings, and
a crew of 16 officers and 181 men. She was a steel twin-screw steamer
of 14,384 tons, built at Glasgow in 1914 for the Anchor Line and had a
speed of 17-&frac12; knots. 212 U. S. soldiers lost their lives. Though hit
without any <span class="pagenum"><a id="page462" name="page462"></a>(p. 462)</span> warning and during the night, the troops reached
their boat stations without panic and in splendid order. Unfortunately
some of the lifeboats capsized, a fact which was responsible for some
of the losses. Others died later in hospitals from shock and exposure;
while still others had fallen victims to the explosion caused by the
two torpedoes. The survivors were landed in Ireland and Scotland,
where those of the bodies which were recovered found a last resting
place. British destroyers were instrumental in saving many lives and
also immediately gave chase to the submarine which, it is believed,
was sunk by depth bombs.</p>

<p>Spanish losses became very heavy. On February 9, 1918, the <i>Sebastian</i>
was sunk in her way to New York; the <i>Mar Caspio</i> went to the bottom
on February 23; the <span class="smcap">Neguri</span> on February 26; the <i>Sardinero</i> on February
27; and a grain ship, chartered to the Swiss Government, on March 2,
1918.</p>

<p>On February 26, 1918, the British steamer <i>Glenart Castle</i>, serving as
a hospital ship, was sunk in Bristol Channel. Fortunately she had no
patients on board; she carried a crew of 120, 54 members of the R. A.
M. C. and 8 female nurses, of whom 153 were reported as missing. This
was the second attack on the boat, the first one having been made on
March 1, 1918, in the channel. She was then full of wounded from
France, all of whom were saved while the vessel itself was taken to
harbor and repaired. The <i>Glenart Castle</i> was formerly known as the
<i>Galician</i> and was previous to the war owned by the Union Castle
Company. She was the seventh British hospital ship torpedoed at night
and without warning.</p>

<p>During February, 1918, too, the British S. S. <i>Minnetonka</i> of 13,528
tons was sunk in the Mediterranean. Previous to the war she had been a
well-known passenger liner of the Atlantic Transport Line, running
between New York and London.</p>

<p>Another large steamer which became the prey of submarine warfare was
the <i>Celtic</i>, torpedoed off the Irish coast on April 1, 1918. However,
she succeeded in reaching port in safety.</p>

<a id="img032" name="img032"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img032.jpg" width="500" height="293" alt="" title="">
<p>It was on April 23, 1918, that the British cruiser
"Vindictive" defended the operation of sinking two old cruisers filled
with cement to block the submarine base at Zeebrugge. On May 10 the
battered "Vindictive" herself was sunk to close the base at Ostend.</p>
</div>

<p>Spanish ships were continued to be sunk and on April 11, 1918, it was
announced that Germany had begun a submarine <span class="pagenum"><a id="page463" name="page463"></a>(p. 463)</span> blockade of
Spanish ports as a result of a commercial treaty signed between Spain
and the United States.</p>

<p>On the same day Uruguay asked the German Government, through the Swiss
minister at Berlin, whether Germany considered that a state of war
existed between the two countries. The inquiry was the result of the
capture by a submarine of a Uruguayan military commission bound for
France.</p>

<p>One of the largest German submarines appeared, on April 10, 1918, in
the port of Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, on the west coast of
Africa, after having seized the day before the small armed Liberian
vessel <i>President Grant</i>. The crew were taken prisoners and the boat
sunk. Liberia, it will be remembered, had declared war against Germany
on August 4, 1917. The German commander dispatched by the Liberian
crew an ultimatum to the Liberian Government, in which he threatened
that, failing the dismantling of the wireless stations and the closing
of the French cable, the town of Monrovia would be bombarded. The
stations were accordingly closed, as the capital was under the fire of
the German guns, but later the U-boat commander insisted upon their
being destroyed. This the Liberian Government refused to do, and the
German submarine thereupon bombarded Monrovia for over an hour,
destroyed the stations, and inflicted some casualties. Fortunately for
the town a steamer appeared at that moment. The submarine gave chase
and did not return again.</p>

<p>The most important American losses in April, 1918, were the S. S.
<i>Lake Moor</i>, manned by naval reserves and sunk in European waters on
April 11, 1918, with a loss of 5 officers and 39 men; the <i>Florence
H.</i>, wrecked by an internal explosion while at anchor in a French
port, with a loss of 29.</p>

<p>Neutral shipping continued to be a heavy loser. The Norwegian
Government, for instance, announced that from the beginning of the war
to the end of April, 1918, Norway's losses had reached the total of
755 vessels, aggregating 1,115,519 tons, and accompanied by the loss
of 1,006 seamen, while 700 more out of additional 53 ships were
missing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page464" name="page464"></a>(p. 464)</span> On the other hand it was announced that during April, 1918,
12 German submarines had been captured or sunk in European waters by
American and British destroyers.</p>

<p>On May 3, 1918, the Old Dominion liner <i>Tyler</i> was sunk off the coast
of France with a loss of 11 men, including 5 naval gunners.</p>

<p>Another British S. S. serving as transport for U. S. troops, the
<i>Moldavia</i>, was torpedoed and sunk on May 23, 1918, 56 U. S. soldiers
being reported as "unaccounted for." Two British transports, the
<i>Ansonia</i> and <i>Leasowe Castle</i>, were sunk on May 26, 1918, with losses
of 40 and 101 lives respectively.</p>

<p>While returning to the United States the U. S. transport <i>President
Lincoln</i>, formerly a Hamburg-American liner, was sunk in the naval war
zone on May 31, 1918, with a loss of 4 officers and 23 men.</p>

<p>In the meantime some German submarines put in their appearance off the
coast of the U. S. They began their operations on May 25, 1918, and
maintained them with varying success and at varying distances from the
coast until well into August, 1918. As a result the following boats
were sunk up to June 20, 1918:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li><i>Jacob H. Haskell</i>, schooner, 1,362 tons.</li>
<li><i>Isabel B. Wiley</i>, schooner, 611 tons.</li>

<p>Later victims were, according to the New York "Times":</p>

<p>The Norwegian freighter <i>Augvald</i>, sunk June 23, 1918, 125 miles east

<p>The American tanker <i>O. B. Jennings</i>, sunk off the Virginia coast.</p>

<p>The American schooner <i>Stanley L. Seaman</i>, sunk on August 5, 1918,
when 110 miles east of Cape Hatteras.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page467" name="page467"></a>(p. 467)</span> Nine American fishing schooners sunk on August 3, 1918, off
George's Bank, 60 miles from Nantucket Island.</p>

<p>The Norwegian freighter <i>Sommerstad</i>, 3,875 gross tons, torpedoed and
sunk 25 miles southeast by east of Fire Island on August 12, 1918.</p>

<p>The British steamship <i>Penistone</i>, 4,139 gross tons, torpedoed on
August 11, 1918, about 100 miles east of Nantucket.</p>

<p>The Swedish steamship <i>Sydland</i>, 3,031 gross tons, bombed and sunk on
August 8, 1918, about 100 miles southeast of Nantucket.</p>

<p>The American oil tanker <i>Frederick R. Kellogg</i>, 7,127 gross tonnage,
torpedoed 10 miles off Barnegat, N. J., sank in 4 minutes; 7 men
killed by the explosion.</p>

<p>The five-masted American schooner <i>Dorothy Barrett</i>, 2,088 gross
tonnage, sunk with a cargo of coal 20 miles from Cape May, N. J.,
August 14, 1918.</p>

<p>It was announced in the U. S. Senate that 28 submarines had been sunk
by the American Navy between January 1 and June 15, 1918.</p>

<p>Norway continued to be a severe loser. Twenty of her ships were sunk
in May, 1918, causing a loss of 31 lives, and 14 more in July, 1918,
with a loss of 55 sailors.</p>

<p>On June 27, 1918, another hospital ship was sunk when the Canadian S.
S. <i>Llandovery Castle</i> went down off the British coast. Two hundred
and thirty-four persons were reported missing.</p>

<p>Another former Hamburg-American liner, the <i>Cincinnati</i>, renamed the
<i>Covington</i>, and serving as a U. S. transport, was sunk while
returning to the U. S. Six of her crew lost their lives.</p>

<p>On July 14, 1918, the French transport <i>Djemnah</i> was sunk in the
Mediterranean with a loss of 442 lives. The well-known former Cunard
liner <i>Carpathia</i>, remembered especially for her services to the
survivors of the ill-fated <i>Titanic</i> and the <i>Volturno</i>, was sent to
the bottom off the west coast of Ireland on July 17, 1918. Three days
later the White Star liner <i>Justicia</i> was sunk off the north Irish
coast after a fight with a submarine lasting 24 hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page468" name="page468"></a>(p. 468)</span> Losses, not resulting from naval actions, to the naval forces
of the various belligerents, as far as they became known, were
comparatively small. Germany, besides her losses of submarines, lost
some destroyers and mine sweepers. Austria, in May, 1918, lost the
battleship <i>Wien</i>. England lost some destroyers, torpedo boats, and
mine sweepers. Seven British submarines, caught in Russian waters by
the collapse of Russia, were sunk by their own crews off Helsingfors
between April 3 and 8, 1918, upon the approach of German naval forces
and transports. The Japanese battleship <i>Kawachi</i>, of 21,420 tons and
20 knots, blew up on July 12, 1918, while at anchor in Tokuyama Bay,
and sank with a loss of over 500 officers and men. The U. S. armored
cruiser <i>San Diego</i> was sunk off Fire Island, N. Y., on July 19, 1918,
by a mine apparently having been laid by one of the German submarines
then operating in American waters.</p>

<p>On February 24, 1918, the German Government announced that the
auxiliary cruiser <i>Wolf</i> had returned to the Austrian harbor Pola,
after a 15 months' cruise in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.
Claims as to the number and tonnage of ships sunk by the <i>Wolf</i> as
made by the German authorities differed widely from the losses
compiled by the British authorities, the former amounting to 35 ships
of 210,000 tons, the latter to 17 ships of about 40,000 tons. One of
the boats attacked by the raider, the Spanish S. S. <i>Igatz Mendi</i>, was
captured, and, after a prize crew had been sent aboard, took over the
passengers and crews of half a dozen ships which had been sunk.
Attempting to return to a German port, she stranded on February 25,
1918, off the Danish coast. Passengers and members of the crews with
civil status were sent to their various homes, while the German prize
crew and some British military men were interned.</p>

<p>A number of minor naval engagements were fought between small units of
the belligerents' naval forces.</p>

<p class="smcap">Italian naval exploits.</p>
</div>

<p>A swift raid was made by a flotilla of large German torpedo-boat
destroyers early in the morning of February 15, 1918, on British
patrol forces in the Dover Straits. One trawler and 7 <span class="pagenum"><a id="page470" name="page470"></a>(p. 470)</span>
drifters, which were occupied in hunting a submarine, which had been
sighted in the patrol, were sunk. After having sunk these vessels the
German destroyers returned rapidly to the north before any of the
Allied forces could engage them. A large number of the crews of the
vessels sunk lost their lives.</p>

<p>A light Franco-British division, composed of three French destroyers
and three British ships, joined battle in the North Sea early in the
morning of March 21, 1918, with a detachment of German torpedo vessels
of the "A" type, two of which were sunk. Shortly afterward, the same
light division fought a second action with five big destroyers which
had been bombarding Dunkirk. One German destroyer was sunk, and it is
probable that two other enemy destroyers were lost.</p>

<p>From information received, it would appear that three flotillas had
been ordered to bombard Dunkirk, La Panne, and Bray Dunes. One of the
British ships was slightly damaged, and returned to port. On the
French side there were neither killed nor wounded.</p>

<p>British boats, belonging to the Grand Fleet, made an excursion into
the Kattegat, the strait between Sweden and Denmark, on April 15,
1918, sinking 10 German trawlers and returning without having suffered
any casualties.</p>

<p>British light forces operating in the Helgoland Bight on April 20,
1918, obtained touch with German light forces, who retired behind mine
fields. A few shots were exchanged at extreme range and one German
destroyer was observed to have been hit.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of April 23, 1918, British naval forces made a
successful attack against Ostend and Zeebrugge, both of them important
German submarine bases. The raid was undertaken under the command of
Vice Admiral Roger Keyes, commanding at Dover French destroyers
cooperating with the British forces. There were six obsolete cruisers
which took part in the attack&mdash;<i>Brilliant</i>, <i>Sirius</i>, <i>Intrepid</i>,
<i>Iphigenia</i>, <i>Thetis</i>, and <i>Vindictive</i>. The first five were filled
with concrete, and were to be sunk in the channels and entrances to
the ports if that could possibly be managed. <i>Vindictive</i>, working
with two auxiliary craft, ferryboats well known on the Mersey,
<i>Daffodil</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page471" name="page471"></a>(p. 471)</span> and <i>Iris</i>, carried storming and demolition
parties to the head of the mole at Zeebrugge. <i>Vindictive</i> was
specially fitted with brows for landing the storming parties and armed
specially for the operation with batteries of Stokes mortars, flame
throwers, &amp;c. The men employed on the blockships and in the storming
and demolition parties were bluejackets and Royal Marines, picked from
a very large number of volunteers from the Grand Fleet.</p>

<p>There were light covering forces belonging to the Dover command, and
Harwich forces, under Admiral Tyrwhitt, covered the operation in the
north.</p>

<p>A force of monitors, together with a large number of motor launches,
coastal motor boats, which, as is known, are small, fast craft,
carrying a minimum crew of six, and other small craft took part in the
operation.</p>

<p>It was a particularly intricate operation, which had to be worked
strictly to time-table and involved very delicate navigation on a
hostile coast without lights and largely under unknown navigational
conditions, which have developed since the war, with the added danger
of unknown mine fields. One of the essentials to success was a high
development of the scientific use of smoke or fog&mdash;it is more fog than
smoke&mdash;for which certain conditions of force and direction of wind
were necessary, so as to protect the operation from batteries which
could have flanked it.</p>

<p>The general plan of operation was as follows:&mdash;After an hour of
intense bombardment of Zeebrugge by the monitors, <i>Vindictive</i>, with
the auxiliaries <i>Iris</i> and <i>Daffodil</i>, were to run alongside the head
of the mole, attacking with gunfire as they approached; storming
parties and demolition parties were to be landed. Meantime three
blockships, assisted by the coastal motor boats and launches, were to
make for the entrance to the canal and to be run aground and blown up.
Two old and valueless submarines were to run against the pile work
connecting the masonry portion of the mole with the shore, and, being
filled with explosives, were to be blown up, destroying the pile-work
connection.</p>

and Ostend.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page473" name="page473"></a>(p. 473)</span> At Ostend the operation was simpler. Two of the blockships
were to be run aground and blown up at the entrance to the port. The
difficulties of this part of the undertaking were considerably
increased by mist and rain, with corresponding low visibility and
consequent absence of effective aerial cooperation.</p>

<p>At Zeebrugge, of the three blockships two attained their objective and
were sunk and blown up in the entrance of the canal. The third one
grounded in the passage in. One of the old submarines succeeded in
obtaining its objective and was blown up to the destruction of the
piling of the approach to the mole. Storming parties from
<i>Vindictive</i>, <i>Iris</i>, and <i>Daffodil</i> attacked under extremely heavy
fire, and fought with the greatest possible gallantry, maintaining
their position alongside the mole for an hour, causing much damage to
the enemy and inflicting considerable losses upon him. The objectives
for the storming and demolition parties were (1) the German forces
holding it, (2) the battery upon it, (3) the destroyer and submarine
depots upon it, (4) the large seaplane base upon it. The three
vessels, <i>Vindictive</i>, <i>Iris</i>, and <i>Daffodil</i>, after reembarking their
landing parties, withdrew. This attack was primarily intended to
engage the attention of the garrison on the mole, thereby allowing the
blockships to enter the harbor.</p>

<p>At Ostend the wind prevented the effective use of the smoke screen and
the two blockships had to be run ashore and blown up without attaining
their objective. The British loss in vessels was small: one destroyer
and two motor launches. But fire from German guns wrought heavy havoc
in the ranks of the British seamen: nineteen officers and 170 men
were killed; two officers and fourteen men were missing, and
twenty-nine officers and 354 men were wounded.</p>

<p>On May 10, 1918, the Ostend operation was completed. The old cruiser
<i>Vindictive</i> was sunk at the entrance to the harbor, after having been
filled with concrete. The losses of the British forces engaged in this
operation were small.</p>

<p>It was later reported that twenty-one German destroyers and a large
number of submarines were penned in the Bruges Canal docks as a result
of the naval operations against Zeebrugge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page474" name="page474"></a>(p. 474)</span> Engagements, without leading to any results, occurred on
April 23, 1918, between five Austrian and two British destroyers.</p>

<p>Early in May, 1918, reports about a mutiny in the Austrian navy, which
was said to have taken place some months before, seemed to be correct.
The mutiny, it was claimed, began at Pola, but spread quickly to
Cattaro. It was among arsenal workmen that the rising, according to
the London "Times," began at Pola. They demanded the cessation of
various disciplinary measures and punishments inflicted both in
vessels and ashore. The movement soon spread to the ships in harbor;
the crews left their posts and thronged the decks shouting, hurrahing,
and acting as they pleased. The officers were powerless, but there
seems to have been no fighting between them and the men. The naval
authorities parleyed with the men for a week, and finally all the
sailors' and workmen's demands were granted.</p>

<p>At Cattaro the mutiny took a more serious turn. Six cruisers and
several destroyers hoisted the red flag. The German and Magyar
elements in some of the ships held aloof, and there were encounters
between them and the mutineers, the guns of one cruiser being turned
on another and some mutineers being killed. However, the mutineers got
the upper hand after three days and became masters of the port.</p>

<p>Negotiations were eventually opened on an equal footing between the
admiral and the mutineers, and finally the latter consented to
surrender their vessels on receiving written guarantees that no action
would be taken against any man, and that a number of grievances would
be settled. The Cattaro fleet then returned under the Austrian flag,
after being eight days in open revolt.</p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER LXX</h2>

<p class="title">BOMBING AND RECONNOISSANCE</p>


<p>The importance of aerial operations, great as it had been since the
beginning of the war, gradually increased in a way which even the most
sanguine believer in the possibilities of flying machines would have
hesitated to prophesy. This was due to a great extent to the
remarkable advance that had been made on all sides as a result of
experience in respect to the mechanical development of airplanes. But
an even greater factor, perhaps, was the development of the technique
of flying, which, step by step, progressed to a point that fell little
short of the miraculous. Especially wonderful appears the development
of squadron flying. So well trained had become the intrepid airmen
that evolutions which a short time ago aroused the admiration of the
whole world when carried out by individual planes and flyers were now
successfully undertaken by large groups, each plane cooperating with
the most wonderful precision and daring with every other unit.</p>

<p>Although the business of scouting, observation, and direction of
artillery operations still formed an important part of the flying
service, new duties had been delegated to the airmen. In
ever-increasing squadrons, mass attacks against hostile forces, both
in the air and on the ground, were being carried out as effectively as
formerly by bodies of cavalry and infantry. Even part of the work,
formerly executed exclusively by the artillery, now had become a
regular feature of the flying arm of the various armies. Large air
squadrons were laying down with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page476" name="page476"></a>(p. 476)</span> their machine guns barrage
fire which had as deadly and accurate results on advancing bodies of
infantry as had previously been achieved only by heavy artillery.</p>

<p>Aerial activity by now had become as regular a part of military
operations on every front as any other form of warfare. The most
important events of the war in the air, of course, occurred on the
most important of the many theaters of war, the western front. Fairly
regular reports, however, are available only for the British air
forces.</p>

<p>During the first week of February, 1918, the weather interfered a
great deal with flying, but in spite of that hardly a day passed
without some bombing expedition being undertaken by British airplanes.
On February 9, 1918, several successful reconnoissances were carried
out by British machines in spite of low clouds, mist, and high winds.
German batteries were engaged effectively by our artillery with
observation from the air, and nearly one ton of bombs was dropped on
various targets. In air fighting, one German machine was driven down
out of control. One British machine, too, was lost.</p>

<p>On the night of February 9-10, 1918, British night bombing machines
carried out a successful raid into Germany, although the weather was
by no means good. Nearly a ton of bombs was dropped with very good
results on the important railway junction and sidings at
Courcelles-les-Metz, southeast of Metz. One of the British bombing
machines failed to return.</p>

<p>On February 11, 1918, mist, high winds, and low clouds again made
weather conditions unfavorable for flying. Little work was possible
with the artillery, but British aeroplanes carried out several
successful reconnoissances, and dropped over a ton of bombs on various
targets behind the German lines. No fighting took place. Another
successful raid into German territory was made, however. The objective
this time was the town of Offenburg, about twelve miles southeast of
Strassburg and about forty miles from the French frontier.</p>

<p>On February 16, 1918, fighting machines on both sides were most
active, and frequent attacks were made by the Germans on British
bombing, photographic, and artillery machines. Fourteen <span class="pagenum"><a id="page477" name="page477"></a>(p. 477)</span>
German machines were brought down, and seven others were driven down
out of control. British antiaircraft guns shot down two other German
machines, one of them being a large bombing machine, which carried
four men. This latter machine fell inside of the British lines and its
four occupants were taken prisoners. Another German aeroplane, making
the 17th accounted for during the day, in addition to those driven
down out of control, landed near one of the British aerodromes, and
its occupants were also taken prisoners. Five British aeroplanes were
reported missing.</p>

<p>During the night of February 16-17, 1918, British machines dropped 400
bombs on German aerodromes in the neighborhood of Ghent, Tournai, and
Laon. The railway station and sidings at Conflans&mdash;fifteen miles west
of Metz&mdash;were also successfully bombed from a low height, bursts being
observed in the sidings.</p>

<p>The weather was again fine and very favorable to aerial actions on
February 17, 1918. Bombing, which had been carried out incessantly
throughout the previous thirty-six hours, was continued, and over six
tons of bombs were dropped by British machines on various targets,
including German aerodromes in the neighborhood of Tournai and Lille,
a large ammunition dump near Courtrai, and numerous billets. Ten
German aeroplanes were brought down and six others were driven down
out of control. Three British machines failed to return.</p>

<p>On the night of February 17-18, 1918, further bombing raids were
carried out against German aerodromes south of Ghent and west of
Tournai as well as against many of the German billets.</p>

<p>Another most successful raid was carried out on the railway station
and sidings at Conflans (west of Metz). A ton of bombs was dropped.</p>

<p>On February 18, 1918, bombing squadrons raided the barracks and
railway station at Trèves, on the Moselle, and the steel works and
railway station at Thionville. The raid was carried out in broad
daylight, and excellent results were obtained. Although German
antiaircraft gunfire was again considerable and accurate, all the
British machines returned safely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page478" name="page478"></a>(p. 478)</span> During that day continuous fighting took place, resulting in
eleven German machines being brought down and six others driven down
out of control. Two British machines were lost.</p>

<p>Following on the successful daylight raids on February 18, 1918,
against Trèves and Thionville, British night flying squadrons went out
after dark and again attacked these towns from a low height with
equally good results. German aircraft and antiaircraft guns were very
active during both raids, and one of the British machines failed to
return.</p>

<p>On February 19, 1918, another raid in broad daylight, making the third
within thirty-six hours, was carried out against Trèves. On this
occasion well over a ton of bombs were dropped on the objective.
Eleven bursts were observed on the railway station and six on
buildings in close proximity to it. Three good fires were started.</p>

<p>During the next day the weather prohibited extensive aerial
activities. But it improved again on February 21, 1918, and British
aeroplanes were able to accomplish a full day's work in the air.</p>

<p>Many successful reconnoissances, in the course of which photographs
were taken, were carried out. The usual work in conjunction with the
artillery continued all day, good visibility enabling excellent
results to be obtained.</p>

<p>More than 300 bombs were dropped on German billets and on railway
sidings at Courtrai, Ledeghem, and southeast of Douai.</p>

<p>In air fighting, seven German machines were brought down and two
others driven down out of control. Three British machines were
reported missing.</p>

<p>During the night of February 21-22, 1918, British aeroplanes dropped a
total of 678 bombs on various targets. Three hundred bombs were
dropped on an aerodrome southeast of Le Cateau used by the German
night bombing squadrons. Nineteen direct hits were observed on
hangars. The remaining bombs were dropped on German aerodromes in the
neighborhood of Ghent and Tournai, and on billets. One of the British
machines failed to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page479" name="page479"></a>(p. 479)</span> On February 24, 1918, in spite of bad weather, British
aeroplanes carried out one or two reconnoissances and observed for
the artillery. Bombs were dropped on various targets, including
German billets, transports, and working parties. Two British machines
were reported missing.</p>

<p>After dark, British night flying squadrons dropped over 200 bombs on
German aerodromes near Courtrai and on billets northeast of St.
Quentin.</p>

<p>On February 25, 1918, low clouds and a very strong wind prevented work
in the air during the day. After dark, the sky cleared, though a very
strong westerly wind continued.</p>

<p>British night bombing squadrons displayed great activity, dropping a
total of over 1,200 bombs in the course of the night. The targets
chiefly attacked were the aerodromes south of Ghent and west of
Tournai used by the German night flying machines, and other aerodromes
in the neighborhood of Courtrai.</p>

<p>German billets round Douai and east of St. Quentin were also heavily
bombed, over 350 bombs being dropped in the latter area. All the
British machines returned.</p>

<p>The weather was fine on February 26, 1918, but a very strong west wind
greatly favored the German machines in air fighting.</p>

<p>British aeroplanes carried out several long-distance reconnoissances
and took many photographs of aerodromes and railway communications in
the back areas, in addition to photographs of German trench lines.</p>

<p>Other British machines working with the artillery were busy all day,
and good visibility enabled good results to be obtained.</p>

<p>Four tons of bombs were dropped on the large railway sidings at
Courtrai, the railway junction midway between Douai and Valenciennes,
two German aerodromes north of Douai, and billets.</p>

<p>Fighting in the air was severe, and many combats took place between
the German scouts and British reconnoissance, bombing, and fighting
machines.</p>

<p>One German aeroplane was forced to land behind the British lines by
one of our scouts. Twelve other German machines <span class="pagenum"><a id="page480" name="page480"></a>(p. 480)</span> were brought
down, and one was driven down out of control. Another machine was
brought down by antiaircraft gunfire. Eight British machines failed to
return.</p>

<p>During the night of February 26-27, 1918, over half a ton of bombs
were dropped on barracks and railway stations at Trèves, four bursts
being observed in furnaces in the gas works and eight in the railway
station. On the same night nearly one and a half tons of bombs were
dropped on a German aerodrome near Metz, good bursts being observed in
the hangars and hutments. One German machine was encountered close to
the aerodrome and brought down. All the British machines returned
safely, though fire from antiaircraft guns and machine guns was
considerable.</p>

<p>British aeroplanes took advantage of the few fine intervals on
February 28, 1918, to carry out work in conjunction with the artillery
and also to drop bombs on two of the German ammunition dumps south of
Lille, as well as on railway sidings at Courtrai and Deynze (southwest
of Ghent). One British machine was lost. After dark British machines
again took the air in the intervals between hailstorms. Four tons of
bombs were dropped on a large German aerodrome midway between Tournai
and Mons, and on billets in the neighborhood of Douai.</p>

<p>Great aerial activity prevailed on March 8, 1918. Work in conjunction
with the artillery, reconnoissances, photography, and bombing was
carried out incessantly by the British aeroplanes. Over 400 bombs were
dropped on German ammunition dumps and sidings at Menin, Busigny, and
Guise, east of St. Quentin, in spite of the most determined attacks
made by the German scouts against the British bombing machines. In air
fighting, twelve German aeroplanes were brought down and ten others
were driven down out of control. Another machine was shot down by
antiaircraft gunfire. Three British aeroplanes were lost. After dark,
the greater part of the front was enveloped in mist, but in one sector
British night flying machines dropped twenty-four heavy bombs and
forty-eight lighter bombs on the ammunition dump and railway sidings
at Fresnoy, northeast of St. Quentin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page481" name="page481"></a>(p. 481)</span> At midday on March 9, 1918, the railway sidings and factories
at Mainz, at the junction of the rivers Rhine and Main, in Germany,
about 130 miles northeast of Nancy, were bombed by British aeroplanes
with good results. Well over a ton of bombs were dropped, and bursts
were seen on and around the barracks, on the railway sidings, and on a
factory. A large fire was started. All the British machines returned.
Six hundred bombs were dropped by other British machines on German
ammunition dumps, billets, and aerodromes, and on an important railway
center northeast of St. Quentin. In particular, a most successful
attack was carried out at a low height by a large number of British
machines against three hostile aerodromes. Bombs were dropped from an
average height of 400 feet, and at each of the aerodromes direct hits
were obtained on hangars and on machines in the open. While returning
from this attack the British pilots flew at a height of 100 feet,
firing on favorable targets on the ground with their machine guns and
causing casualties and much confusion among the Germans. In one case a
horse transport on the road was engaged, with the result that some of
the wagons were upset into the ditch. In another horses in an orchard
were stampeded. A company of German infantry was scattered in all
directions and a group of officers on horseback dispersed. The
fighting in the air was heavy. Ten German machines were brought down
and ten others driven down out of control. A German observation
balloon was also destroyed. Two of the British machines failed to
return.</p>

<p>On March 10, 1918, Germany was again bombed by British aeroplanes in
broad daylight. On this occasion the Daimler Motor Works at Stuttgart
were attacked, and over one and a quarter tons of bombs were dropped.
Stuttgart is about 136 miles east of Nancy. Several bursts were
observed on the railway station, where a stationary train was hit and
set on fire. Three bursts were seen on the munition factory southeast
of the town, and other bursts on the Daimler works and on buildings
round them. German machines made a weak attempt to attack the
formation over the objective, but withdrew on being attacked. All the
British machines returned except one, which evidently <span class="pagenum"><a id="page482" name="page482"></a>(p. 482)</span> had
engine trouble and went down under control just before recrossing the
lines on the homeward journey.</p>

<p>During the same day the thick haze rendered work in conjunction with
the artillery almost impossible. Several reconnoissances, however,
were carried out, and over 400 bombs were dropped. Among other
targets, Menin, Roulers, Ledeghem, Cambrai, and Solesmes railway
stations were bombed by British machines. Three German observation
balloons were destroyed, and five German machines were brought down in
air fighting, in addition to seven others driven down out of control.
One low-flying German machine was shot down by British infantry. Four
British aeroplanes were lost.</p>

<p>Another fine day on March 11, 1918, enabled the British aeroplanes to
continue their activity. Visibility, however, was again poor and
prevented work with the artillery from achieving much success. Over
500 bombs were dropped, the chief target being the large sidings and
ammunition depots at Aulnoye, southeast of Maubeuge, and ammunition
depots south of Valenciennes, southeast of Cambrai, and south of
Douai. As the result of air fighting ten German machines were brought
down and seven others were driven down out of control. In addition a
German observation balloon was attacked, and brought down in flames.
Two British machines were lost. After dark most of the British night
bombing machines were again prevented from leaving the ground by mist,
but on the southern portion of the front, where the night was clear,
200 bombs were dropped on a German ammunition dump and railway sidings
northeast of St. Quentin. The Germans also dropped a few bombs during
the night, but lost a four-seater machine, which landed in the lines.
The occupants were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>On March 12, 1918, another daylight raid into Germany, making the
third within four days, was carried out by British aeroplanes. On this
occasion the factories and station and the barracks at Coblenz, at
the junction of the Rhine and the Moselle, 135 miles north-northeast
of Nancy and about fifty miles southeast of Cologne, were attacked.
Over a ton of bombs were dropped, and bursts were seen on all the
objectives, causing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page483" name="page483"></a>(p. 483)</span> two fires. A hit obtained upon a building
in the southwest corner of the town created a very large explosion. A
few German machines were encountered, but all the British machines
returned safely.</p>

<p>During the night of March 11-12, 1918, in addition to the raids
already reported, over three tons of bombs were dropped on Bruges
docks.</p>

<p>On March 12, 1918, a distinct improvement in visibility enabled more
work to be done in conjunction with the artillery than had been
possible during the last few days. Many reconnoissances also were
carried out and photographs were taken. Bombing was continued with
even greater vigor than on previous days. Over thirteen and a half
tons of bombs were dropped on various targets, which included the
railway sidings at Mons and at Bavai, midway between Valenciennes and
Maubeuge, on large ammunition depots northeast of St. Quentin, and
south of Douai, and on billets east of Lens. In the course of the
fighting, which was continuous throughout the day, fourteen German
machines were brought down, and eight others were driven down out of
control. One hostile observation balloon was also destroyed. Six
British aeroplanes were bagged by the Germans.</p>

<p>During the night of March 12-13, 1918, seven tons of bombs were
dropped on German billets between Lille and Cambrai. On the afternoon
of March 13, 1918, British squadrons attacked the munition works and
barracks at Freiburg, in Germany. All machines reached their
objectives, and nearly a ton of bombs was dropped. They were seen to
burst on the railway station and round the power station. Just after
the British pilots had released their bombs their formation was
attacked by a large number of German machines. A fierce fight ensued,
which lasted until all the German machines had been forced to
withdraw. Three of the British machines failed to return.</p>

<p>On March 16, 1918, further military objectives in Germany were
attacked by British aeroplanes. Fourteen heavy and ten lighter bombs
were dropped on the barracks, munition factories, and railway station
of Zweibrücken, in the Rhine Palatinate. Bursts were seen on the
barracks and all round the railway <span class="pagenum"><a id="page484" name="page484"></a>(p. 484)</span> station. The formation was
attacked by German scouts and engaged by antiaircraft guns, but all
machines returned.</p>

<p>Still another raid into Germany was made on the next day, March 17,
1918. The barracks and railway station at Kaiserslautern, likewise in
the Rhine Palatinate, were attacked with good results. Direct hits
were observed on the railway station and a large fire was caused. The
formation was attacked by a large number of German machines, which
were driven off. All the British machines returned.</p>

<p>During that day the German billets, which had been bombed continually
for the last twenty-four hours, were again heavily attacked. A total
of thirteen tons of bombs were dropped, the objectives including two
German aerodromes and three large ammunition dumps, in addition to
billets. At one of the aerodromes a hangar was completely burned, and
a Gotha machine which was in the act of rising from the ground was
seen to crash.</p>

<p>The fighting was intense during the morning, but became slightly less
vigorous during the afternoon. Sixteen German machines were brought
down and seven others were driven down out of control. Six British
machines were reported missing. After dark the German rest billets
were again attacked, bombs being dropped until just after midnight,
when a thick mist developed.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was again clear on March 18, 1918, and favored the
cooperation of the aeroplanes and artillery. Several long-distance
reconnoissances were successfully completed, and many photographs were
taken. Nine tons of bombs were dropped on German rest billets and
ammunition dumps and also on Busigny railway station and two German
aerodromes. Fighting in the air was exceedingly intense, encounters
taking place between large formations of British and German machines.
Nineteen German aeroplanes were brought down and nine driven down out
of control. Twelve British machines failed to return.</p>

<p>British bombing machines also attacked military objectives at
Mannheim, on the Rhine, dropping over a ton of bombs with excellent
results. These aeroplanes were attacked by two German formations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page485" name="page485"></a>(p. 485)</span> Following a successful daylight raid on Mannheim, other
objectives in Germany were attacked during the night. Half a ton of
bombs were dropped on the railway stations at Cologne, where a fire
was started. Over a ton was distributed between Luxemburg railway
station, where a fire was started, and Courcelles railway station,
east of Metz. Two tons of bombs were dropped on Metz railway station.
Direct hits were obtained on a bridge southeast of the town and on a
stationary train, which was set on fire. A large fire was started on
this occasion also. Other machines dropped a ton of bombs on
Thionville railway station, where a moving train was derailed.</p>

<p>On March 25, 1918, British aeroplanes were employed almost entirely at
combing the enemy's troops and transports massed in the areas behind
the battle front and in attacking them with machine-gun fire from a
low height. A total of twenty-two tons of bombs were dropped in this
work and over 100,000 rounds were fired from machine guns. A certain
amount of fighting in the air took place, but it was less intense than
on the previous day. Thirteen German machines were brought down and
ten were driven down out of control. Eight British machines were
reported missing. During the night British night flying aeroplanes
continued to bomb and to attack with machine-gun fire German troops in
their forward areas and their transports on the roads leading to the
front.</p>

<p>Thirty tons of bombs were dropped, and hundreds of thousands of rounds
of ammunition were fired into the German ranks. While this fighting
was maintained throughout the day, British infantry aeroplanes kept
watch along the front and reported the changes in the situation as
they occurred. Twenty German machines were brought down in air
fighting, and two other German aeroplanes were shot down by
antiaircraft guns. Twelve British aeroplanes were reported missing.</p>

<p>During the night British night flying squadrons kept up a continuous
attack upon the German troops in Bapaume, Cambrai, and Péronne.
Twenty-five thousand rounds were fired by them, and twenty-four tons
of bombs were dropped on important centers of the battle front. In
addition, four tons of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page486" name="page486"></a>(p. 486)</span> bombs were dropped on Valenciennes
railway station, through which the German troop trains were passing on
their way to the front.</p>

<p>On March 27, 1918, low flying was again carried out by large bodies of
British aeroplanes, while infantry machines continued the work of
reporting the position of the British battle line. Over thirty tons of
bombs were dropped and a quarter of a million rounds of ammunition
were fired from a height that insured accuracy on different targets.
Several casualties were inflicted on the Germans and the bringing up
of their troops and ammunition was delayed. Twenty-four German
machines were brought down in air fighting, and seven others were
driven down out of control. Two observation balloons were also
destroyed.</p>

<p>Nineteen British machines failed to return, though a proportion of
these were known to have landed on their side of the line. Very heavy
fire directed against the British machines from the ground accounted
for the greater portion of the casualties.</p>

<p>During the night the bombing of Bapaume, Bray, and Péronne was
continued with the utmost vigor. Over a thousand bombs were dropped,
and thousands of rounds of ammunition were fired at good targets,
which were plentiful and easy to see in the moonlight. Sablon station
at Metz was bombed. Well over a ton of bombs were dropped; good bursts
were seen on the sidings and alongside the railway.</p>

<p>On March 28, 1918, British machines carried out a successful raid on
the station at Luxemburg. Twenty-one heavy bombs were dropped, and
several were seen to burst on the objectives.</p>

<p>On March 28, 1918, British aeroplanes carried on their attacks with
bombs and machine-gun fire on German troops on the battle front. The
majority of these attacks took place south of the Somme, in which area
large concentrations of German troops were constantly reported. The
work was continued till dark in spite of bombs being dropped, and
nearly a quarter of a million rounds of ammunition being fired. Nine
German machines were brought down and five others driven down out of
control. In addition, two machines were shot down by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page487" name="page487"></a>(p. 487)</span> fire
from the ground. Twelve British machines were reported missing.</p>

<p>During the morning of March 29, 1918, low clouds and rain greatly
interfered with flying, but, in spite of the weather, valuable work
was again accomplished by the British aeroplanes. Some of these were
concentrated upon the battle front south of the Somme, where observers
had previously reported large German columns. A good deal of fighting
took place, the German low-flying machines being particularly active
in this area. Nine German aeroplanes were brought down and two others
were driven down out of control. Two British machines were lost.
During the night over twelve tons of bombs were dropped on Bapaume and
on roads in the vicinity, and also on roads and villages east of
Arras. Direct hits were obtained on dumps and transports and on the
railway line.</p>

<p>After midday on March 30, 1918, the weather completely broke, but, in
spite of driving rain, British pilots continued to take part in the
battle south of the Somme, and dropped bombs and used their machine
guns until a late hour. There was heavy fighting in the air between
British low-flying machines and those of the Germans. Twelve of the
latter were brought down and three others were driven down out of
control. One German balloon was destroyed, and two German aeroplanes
were shot down by antiaircraft guns. Five British planes failed to
return.</p>

<p>On March 31, 1918, British observation balloons and aeroplanes were
active, the good visibility enabling the former to carry out useful
work in conjunction with the artillery. The activity of the aeroplanes
was chiefly centered south of the Somme. A close watch was kept on
German movements in this area, and a large column of their troops or
transports seen was bombed and engaged with machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>Very little fighting took place in the air. Two German machines were
brought down and one other was driven down out of control. Four
British machines were reported missing. Night flying was not possible
till after midnight owing to low clouds. From midnight until dawn
British bombing machines were constantly at work. Twenty-four tons of
bombs were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page488" name="page488"></a>(p. 488)</span> dropped on the railway stations at Douai, Cambrai,
Bapaume, Rosières, and Thourout, and on the docks at Bruges. Troops
and transports in the neighborhood of Bapaume and Chaulnes were also
attacked with bombs and machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>This completed the work of the British flying corps on the western
front for March, 1918. A remarkable record had been made, 383 German
machines having been destroyed or captured and 207 driven down out of
control, while only 155 British machines had been reported missing.
The French, too, had been notably active during March, having captured
or destroyed 115 German machines.</p>
